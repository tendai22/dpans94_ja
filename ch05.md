# 5. Compliance and labeling 

## 5.1 ANS Forth systems 


### 5.1.1 System compliance 


## 4.1 System documentation and their sub-sections is a Standard System. An otherwise Standard System 

(Subset) that fails to comply with one or more of the minimum values or ranges specified in 3. Usage 
ANSI X3.215-1994  A system that complies with all the system requirements given in sections 3. Usage requirements and  that provides only a portion of the Core words is a Standard System Subset. An otherwise Standard System  requirements and its sub-sections has environmental restrictions.

### 5.1.2 System labeling 

A Standard System (Subset) shall be labeled an “ANS Forth System (Subset)”. That label, by itself, shall  not be applied to Standard Systems or Standard System Subsets that have environmental restrictions.
The phrase “with Environmental Restrictions” shall be appended to the label of a Standard System (Subset)  that has environmental restrictions.
The phrase “Providing name(s) from the Core Extensions word set” shall be appended to the label of any  Standard System that provides portions of the Core Extensions word set.
The phrase “Providing the Core Extensions word set” shall be appended to the label of any Standard System  that provides all of the Core Extensions word set.

## 5.2 ANS Forth programs 


### 5.2.1 Program compliance 


A program that complies with all the program requirements given in sections 3. Usage requirements and  ## 4.2 Program documentation and their sub-sections is a Standard Program.


### 5.2.2 Program labeling 

A Standard Program shall be labeled an “ANS Forth Program”. That label, by itself, shall not be applied to  Standard Programs that require the system to provide standard words outside the Core word set or that have  environmental dependencies.
The phrase “with Environmental Dependencies” shall be appended to the label of Standard Programs that  have environmental dependencies.
The phrase “Requiring name(s) from the Core Extensions word set” shall be appended to the label of  Standard Programs that require the system to provide portions of the Core Extensions word set.
The phrase “Requiring the Core Extensions word set” shall be appended to the label of Standard Programs  that require the system to provide all of the Core Extensions word set.
