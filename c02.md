# C.2 History of Forth 

Forth was invented by Charles H. Moore. A direct outgrowth of Moore’s work in the 1960’s, the first  program to be called Forth was written in about 1970. The first complete implementation was used in 1971  at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory’s 11-meter radio telescope in Arizona. This system was  responsible for pointing and tracking the telescope, collecting data and recording it on magnetic tape, and  supporting an interactive graphics terminal on which an astronomer could analyze previously recorded data.
The multi-tasking nature of the system allowed all these functions to be performed concurrently, without  timing conflicts or other interference – a very advanced concept for that time.
The system was so useful that astronomers from all over the world began asking for copies. Its use spread  rapidly, and in 1976 Forth was adopted as a standard language by the International Astronomical Union.
In 1973, Moore and colleagues formed FORTH, Inc. to explore commercial uses of the language. FORTH,  Inc. developed multi-user versions of Forth on minicomputers for diverse projects ranging from data bases  to scientific applications such as image processing. In 1977, FORTH, Inc. developed a version for the  newly introduced 8-bit microprocessors called “microFORTH”, which was successfully used in embedded  microprocessor applications in the United States, Britain and Japan.
Stimulated by the volume marketing of microFORTH, a group of computer hobbyists in Northern California  became interested in Forth, and in 1978 formed the Forth Interest Group (FIG). They developed a  simplified model which they implemented on several microprocessors and published listings and disks at  very low cost. Interest in Forth spread rapidly, and today there are chapters of the Forth Interest Group  throughout the U.S. and in over fifteen countries.
By 1980, a number of new Forth vendors had entered the market with versions of Forth based upon the FIG  model. Primarily designed for personal computers, these relatively inexpensive Forth systems have been  distributed very widely.
