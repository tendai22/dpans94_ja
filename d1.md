# D.1 FIG Forth (circa 1978) 

(FIG). In FIG Forth, a relatively small number of words were implemented in processor-dependent machine 
FIG Forth was a “model” implementation of the Forth language developed by the Forth Interest Group  language and the rest of the words were implemented in Forth. The FIG model was placed in the public  domain, and was ported to a wide variety of computer systems. Because the bulk of the FIG Forth  implementation was the same across all machines, programs written in FIG Forth enjoyed a substantial  degree of portability, even for “system-level” programs that directly manipulate the internals of the Forth  system implementation.
FIG Forth implementations were influential in increasing the number of people interested in using Forth.
Many people associate the implementation techniques embodied in the FIG Forth model with “the nature of  Forth”.
However, FIG Forth was not necessarily representative of commercial Forth implementations of the same  era. Some of the most successful commercial Forth systems used implementation techniques different from  the FIG Forth “model”.
