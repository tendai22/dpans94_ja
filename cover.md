||Foreword||
(This foreword is not a part of American National Standard X3.215-1994)

Forth is a language for direct communication between human beings and machines. Using  natural-language diction and machine-oriented syntax, Forth provides an economical,  productive environment for interactive compilation and execution of programs. Forth also  provides low-level access to computer-controlled hardware, and the ability to extend the  language itself. This extensibility allows the language to be quickly expanded and adapted  to special needs and different hardware systems.

Forth was invented by Mr. Charles Moore to increase programmer productivity without  sacrificing machine efficiency. Forth is a layered environment containing the elements of  a computer language as well as those of an operating system and a machine monitor. This  extensible, layered environment provides for highly interactive program development and  testing.

In the interests of transportability of application software written in Forth, standardization  efforts began in the mid-1970s by an international group of users and implementors who  adopted the name “Forth Standards Team”. This effort resulted in the Forth-77 Standard.
As the language continued to evolve, an interim Forth-78 Standard was published by the  Forth Standards Team. Following Forth Standards Team meetings in 1979, the Forth-79  Standard was published in 1980. Major changes were made by the Forth Standards Team  in the Forth-83 Standard, which was published in 1983.

1988, May 25-28, 1988, August 10-13, 1988, October 26-29, 1988, January 25-28, 1989, 
1990, August 21-25, 1990, November 6-10,1990, January 29-February 2, 1991, May 3-4, 
1991, June 16-19, 1991, July 30-August 3, 1991, March 17-21, 1992, October 13-17, 

The first meeting of the Technical Committee on Forth Programming Systems was  convened by the Organizing Committee of the X3J14 Forth Technical Committee on  August 3, 1987, and has met subsequently on November 11-12, 1987, February 10-12,  May 3-6, 1989, July 26-29, 1989, October 25-28, 1989, January 24-27, 1990, May 22-26,  1992, January 26-30, 1993, June 28-30, 1993, and June 21, 1994.
