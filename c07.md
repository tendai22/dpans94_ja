# C.7 Design and management considerations 

Just as the choice of building materials has a strong effect on the design and construction of a building, the  choice of language and operating system will affect both application design and project management  decisions.
“successive prototyping” wherein high-level Forth is used as an executable design tool, with “stubs” 
Conventionally, software projects progress through four stages: analysis, design, coding, and testing. A  Forth project necessarily incorporates these activities as well. Forth is optimized for a project-management  methodology featuring small teams of skilled professionals. Forth encourages an iterative process of  replacing lower-level routines as necessary (e.g., for hardware that isn’t built yet).
In many cases successive prototyping can produce a sounder, more useful product. As the project  progresses, implementors learn things that could lead to a better design. Wiser decisions can be made if  true relative costs are known, and often this isn’t possible until prototype code can be written and tried.
Using Forth can shorten the time required for software development, and reduce the level of effort required  for maintenance and modifications during the life of the product as well.
