# D.3 Forth 83 

The Forth-83 Standard, also by the Forth Standards Team, was released in 1983. Forth 83 attempted to fix  some of the deficiencies of Forth 79.
Forth 83 was similar to Forth 79 in most respects. However, Forth 83 changed the definition of several  well-defined features of Forth 79. For example, the rounding behavior of integer division, the base value of  the operands of PICK and ROLL, the meaning of the address returned by ', the compilation behavior of ',  the value of a “true” flag, the meaning of NOT, and the “chaining” behavior of words defined by  VOCABULARY were all changed. Forth 83 relaxed the implementation restrictions of Forth 79 to allow any  kind of threaded code, but it did not fully allow compilation to native machine code (this was not  specifically prohibited, but rather was an indirect consequence of another provision).
Many new Forth implementations were based on the Forth-83 Standard, but few “strictly compliant”  Forth-83 implementations exist.
Although the incompatibilities resulting from the changes between Forth 79 and Forth 83 were usually  relatively easy to fix, a number of successful Forth vendors did not convert their implementations to be  Forth 83 compliant. For example, the most successful commercial Forth for Apple Macintosh computers is  based on Forth 79.
