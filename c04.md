# C.4 Standardization efforts 

The first major effort to standardize Forth was a meeting in Utrecht in 1977. The attendees produced a  preliminary standard, and agreed to meet the following year. The 1978 meeting was also attended by  members of the newly formed Forth Interest Group. In 1979 and 1980 a series of meetings attended by both  users and vendors produced a more comprehensive standard called Forth 79.
Although Forth 79 was very influential, many Forth users and vendors found serious flaws in it, and in 1983  a new standard called Forth 83 was released.
Encouraged by the widespread acceptance of Forth 83, a group of users and vendors met in 1986 to  investigate the feasibility of an American National Standard. The X3J14 Technical Committee for ANS  Forth held its first meeting in 1987. This Standard is the result.
