# A.14 The optional Memory-Allocation word set 

The Memory-Allocation word set provides a means for acquiring memory other than the contiguous data  space that is allocated by ALLOT. In many operating system environments it is inappropriate for a process  to pre-allocate large amounts of contiguous memory (as would be necessary for the use of ALLOT). The  Memory-Allocation word set can acquire memory from the system at any time, without knowing in advance  the address of the memory that will be acquired.
