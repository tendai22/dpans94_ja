# 2. Terms, notation, and references 

This Standard designates the following words as obsolescent:  The phrase “See:” is used throughout this Standard to direct the reader to other sections of the Standard that  have a direct bearing on the current section.
In this Standard, “shall” states a requirement on a system or program; conversely, “shall not” is a  prohibition; “need not” means “is not required to”; “should” describes a recommendation of the Standard;  and “may”, depending on context, means “is allowed to” or “might happen”.

Throughout the Standard, typefaces are used in the following manner:  new terms;  – A bold monospaced serif typeface is used for Forth-language text.

## 2.1 Definitions of terms 

Terms defined in this section are used generally throughout this Standard. Additional terms specific to  individual word sets are defined in those word sets. Other terms are defined at their first appearance,  indicated by italic type. Terms not defined in this Standard are to be construed according to the Dictionary for Information Systems, ANSI X3.172-1990.
address unit: Depending on context, either 1) the units into which a Forth address space is divided for the  purposes of locating data objects such as characters and variables; 2) the physical memory storage elements  corresponding to those units; 3) the contents of such a memory storage element; or 4) the units in which the  length of a region of memory is expressed.
aligned address: The address of a memory location at which a character, cell, cell pair, or double-cell  integer can be accessed.
ambiguous condition: A circumstance for which this Standard does not prescribe a specific behavior for  Forth systems and programs.
Ambiguous conditions include such things as the absence of a needed delimiter while parsing, attempted  access to a nonexistent file, or attempted use of a nonexistent word. An ambiguous condition also exists  when a Standard word is passed values that are improper or out of range.
cell: The primary unit of information in the architecture of a Forth system.
cell pair: Two cells that are treated as a single unit.
character: Depending on context, either 1) a storage unit capable of holding a character; or 2) a member of  a character set.
character-aligned address: The address of a memory location at which a character can be accessed.
character string: Data space that is associated with a sequence of consecutive character-aligned addresses.
Character strings usually contain text. Unless otherwise indicated, the term “string” means “character  string”.
code space: The logical area of the dictionary in which word semantics are implemented.
compile: To transform source code into dictionary definitions.
compilation semantics: The behavior of a Forth definition when its name is encountered by the text  interpreter in compilation state.
counted string: A data structure consisting of one character containing a length followed by zero or more  contiguous data characters. Normally, counted strings contain text.
cross compiler: A system that compiles a program for later execution in an environment that may be  physically and logically different from the compiling environment. In a cross compiler, the term “host”  applies to the compiling environment, and the term “target” applies to the run-time environment.
current definition: The definition whose compilation has been started but not yet ended.
data field: The data space associated with a word defined via CREATE.
data space: The logical area of the dictionary that can be accessed.
data-space pointer: The address of the next available data space location, i.e., the value returned by  HERE.
data stack: A stack that may be used for passing parameters between definitions. When there is no  possibility of confusion, the data stack is referred to as “the stack”. Contrast with return stack.
data type: An identifier for the set of values that a data object may have.
defining word: A Forth word that creates a new definition when executed.
definition: A Forth execution procedure compiled into the dictionary.
dictionary: An extensible structure that contains definitions and associated data space.
display: To send one or more characters to the user output device.
environmental dependencies: A program’s implicit assumptions about a Forth system’s implementation  options or underlying hardware. For example, a program that assumes a cell size greater than 16 bits is said  to have an environmental dependency.
execution semantics: The behavior of a Forth definition when it is executed.
execution token: A value that identifies the execution semantics of a definition.
find: To search the dictionary for a definition name matching a given string.
immediate word: A Forth word whose compilation semantics are to perform its execution semantics.
implementation defined: Denotes system behaviors or features that must be provided and documented by  a system but whose further details are not prescribed by this Standard.
implementation dependent: Denotes system behaviors or features that must be provided by a system but  whose further details are not prescribed by this Standard.
input buffer: A region of memory containing the sequence of characters from the input source that is  currently accessible to a program.
input source: The device, file, block, or other entity that supplies characters to refill the input buffer.
input source specification: A set of information describing a particular state of the input source, input  buffer, and parse area. This information is sufficient, when saved and restored properly, to enable the  nesting of parsing operations on the same or different input sources.
interpretation semantics: The behavior of a Forth definition when its name is encountered by the text  interpreter in interpretation state.
keyboard event: A value received by the system denoting a user action at the user input device. The term  “keyboard” in this document does not exclude other types of user input devices.
line: A sequence of characters followed by an actual or implied line terminator.
name space: The logical area of the dictionary in which definition names are stored.
number: In this Standard, “number” used without other qualification means “integer”. Similarly, “double  number” means “double-cell integer”.
parse: To select and exclude a character string from the parse area using a specified set of delimiting  characters, called delimiters.
parse area: The portion of the input buffer that has not yet been parsed, and is thus available to the system  for subsequent processing by the text interpreter and other parsing operations.
pictured-numeric output: A number display format in which the number is converted using Forth words  that resemble a symbolic “picture” of the desired output.
program: A complete specification of execution to achieve a specific function (application task) expressed  in Forth source code form.
receive: To obtain characters from the user input device.
return stack: A stack that may be used for program execution nesting, do-loop execution, temporary  storage, and other purposes.
standard word: A named Forth procedure, formally specified in this Standard.
user input device: The input device currently selected as the source of received data, typically a keyboard.
user output device: The output device currently selected as the destination of display data.
variable: A named region of data space located and accessed by its memory address.
word: Depending on context, either 1) the name of a Forth definition; or 2) a parsed sequence of non-space  characters, which could be the name of a Forth definition.
word list: A list of associated Forth definition names that may be examined during a dictionary search.
word set: A set of Forth definitions grouped together in this Standard under a name indicating some shared  aspect, typically their common functional area.

## 2.2 Notation 


### 2.2.1 Numeric notation 

Unless otherwise stated, all references to numbers apply to signed single-cell integers. The inclusive range  of values is shown as {from...to}. The allowable range for the contents of an address is shown in double  braces, particularly for the contents of variables, e.g., BASE {{2...36}}.

### 2.2.2 Stack notation 

( stack-id before -- after )
Stack parameters input to and output from a definition are described using the notation:  where stack-id specifies which stack is being described, before represents the stack-parameter data types  before execution of the definition and after represents them after execution. The symbols used in before and after are shown in table 3.1.
The control-flow-stack stack-id is “C:”, the data-stack stack-id is “S:”, and the return-stack stack-id is “R:”.
When there is no confusion, the data-stack stack-id may be omitted.
When there are alternate after representations, they are described by “after1 | after2”. The top of the stack is  to the right. Only those stack items required for or provided by execution of the definition are shown.

### 2.2.3 Parsed-text notation 

If, in addition to using stack parameters, a definition parses text, that text is specified by an abbreviation  from table 2.1, shown surrounded by double-quotes and placed between the before parameters and the “--”  separator in the first stack described, e.g.,  ( S: before “parsed-text-abbreviation” -- after ).
<char> the delimiting character marking the end of the string being 
<chars> zero or more consecutive occurrences of the character char
<space> a delimiting space character 
<spaces> zero or more consecutive occurrences of the character space
<quote> a delimiting double quote 
<paren> a delimiting right parenthesis 
<eol> an implied delimiter marking the end of a line 

### 2.2.4 Glossary notation 

Table 2.1 – Parsed text abbreviations  Abbreviation Description  parsed  ccc a parsed sequence of arbitrary characters, excluding the  delimiter character  name a token delimited by space, equivalent to ccc<space> or  ccc<eol> The glossary entries for each word set are listed in the standard ASCII collating sequence. Each glossary  entry specifies an ANS Forth word and consists of two parts: an index line and the semantic description of  the definition.

#### 2.2.4.1 Glossary index line 

– Section number, the last four digits of which assign a unique sequential number to all words included in 
– DEFINITION-NAME in upper-case, mono-spaced, bold-face letters; 
– Natural-language pronunciation in quotes if it differs from English; 
The index line is a single-line entry containing, from left to right:  this Standard;  – Word-set designator from table 2.2. The designation for extensions word sets includes “EXT”.

#### 2.2.4.2 Glossary semantic description 

Table 2.2 – Word set designators  Word set Designator  Core word set CORE  Block word set BLOCK  Double-Number word set DOUBLE  Exception word set EXCEPTION  Facility word set FACILITY  File-Access word set FILE  Floating-Point word set FLOATING  Locals word set LOCALS  Memory-Allocation word set MEMORY  Programming-Tools word set TOOLS  Search-Order word set SEARCH  String-Handling word set STRING  The first paragraph of the semantic description contains a stack notation for each stack affected by  execution of the word. The remaining paragraphs contain a text description of the semantics. See 3.4.3  Semantics.
