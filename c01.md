# C.1 Features of Forth 

Forth provides an interactive programming environment. Its primary uses have been in scientific and  industrial applications such as instrumentation, robotics, process control, graphics and image processing,  artificial intelligence and business applications. The principal advantages of Forth include rapid, interactive  software development and efficient use of computer hardware.
Forth is often spoken of as a language because that is its most visible aspect. But in fact, Forth is both more  and less than a conventional programming language: more in that all the capabilities normally associated  with a large portfolio of separate programs (compilers, editors, etc.) are included within its range and less in  that it lacks (deliberately) the complex syntax characteristic of most high-level languages.
The original implementations of Forth were stand-alone systems that included functions normally performed  by separate operating systems, editors, compilers, assemblers, debuggers and other utilities. A single  simple, consistent set of rules governed this entire range of capabilities. Today, although very fast standalone versions are still marketed for many processors, there are also many versions that run co-resident with  conventional operating systems such as MS-DOS and UNIX.
Forth is not derived from any other language. As a result, its appearance and internal characteristics may  seem unfamiliar to new users. But Forth’s simplicity, extreme modularity, and interactive nature offset the  initial strangeness, making it easy to learn and use. A new Forth programmer must invest some time  mastering its large command repertoire. After a month or so of full-time use of Forth, that programmer  could understand more of its internal working than is possible with conventional operating systems and  compilers.
The most unconventional feature of Forth is its extensibility. The programming process in Forth consists of  defining new “words” – actually new commands in the language. These may be defined in terms of  previously defined words, much as one teaches a child concepts by explaining them in terms of previously  understood concepts. Such words are called “high-level definitions”. Alternatively, new words may also be  defined in assembly code, since most Forth implementations include an assembler for the host processor.
This extensibility facilitates the development of special application languages for particular problem areas  or disciplines.
Forth’s extensibility goes beyond just adding new commands to the language. With equivalent ease, one  can also add new kinds of words. That is, one may create a word which itself will define words. In creating  such a defining word the programmer may specify a specialized behavior for the words it will create which  will be effective at compile time, at run-time, or both. This capability allows one to define specialized data  types, with complete control over both structure and behavior. Since the run-time behavior of such words  may be defined either in high-level or in code, the words created by this new defining word are equivalent to  all other kinds of Forth words in performance. Moreover, it is even easy to add new compiler directives to  implement special kinds of loops or other control structures.
Most professional implementations of Forth are written in Forth. Many Forth systems include a “metacompiler” which allows the user to modify the internal structure of the Forth system itself.
