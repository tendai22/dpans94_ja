# C.6 Multiprogrammed systems 

Multiprogrammed Forth systems have existed since about 1970. The earliest public Forth systems  propagated the “hooks” for this capability despite the fact that many did not use them. Nevertheless the  underlying assumptions have been common knowledge in the community, and there exists considerable  common ground among these multiprogrammed systems. These systems are not just language processors,  but contain operating system characteristics as well. Many of these integrated systems run entirely standalone, performing all necessary operating system functions.
Some Forth systems are very fast, and can support both multi-tasking and multi-user operation even on  computers whose hardware is usually thought incapable of such advanced operation. For example, one  producer of telephone switchboards is running over 50 tasks on a Z80. There are several multiprogrammed  products for PC’s, some of which even support multiple users. Even on computers that are commonly used  in multi-user operations, the number of users that can be supported may be much larger than expected. One  large data-base application running on a single 68000 has over 100 terminals updating and querying its  data-base, with no significant degradation.
Multi-user systems may also support multiple programmers, each of which has a private dictionary, stacks,  and a set of variables controlling that task. The private dictionary is linked to a shared, re-entrant dictionary  containing all the standard Forth functions. The private dictionary can be used to develop application code  which may later be integrated into the shared dictionary. It may also be used to perform functions requiring  text interpretation, including compilation and execution of source code.
