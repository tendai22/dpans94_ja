# A.17 The optional String word set 


## A.17.6 Glossary 


#### A.17.6.1.0245 /STRING 

/STRING is used to remove or add characters relative to the “left” end of the character string. Positive 
values of n will exclude characters from the string while negative values of n will include characters to the  left of the string. /STRING is a natural factor of WORD and commonly available.

#### A.17.6.1.0910 CMOVE 

If c-addr2 lies within the source region (i.e., when c-addr2 is not less than c-addr1 and c-addr2 is less than  the quantity c-addr1 u CHARS +), memory propagation occurs.
Typical use: Assume a character string at address 100: “ABCD”. Then after  100 DUP CHAR+ 3 CMOVE the string at address 100 is “AAAA”.
Rationale for CMOVE and CMOVE> follows MOVE.

#### A.17.6.1.0920 CMOVE> 

If c-addr1 lies within the destination region (i.e., when c-addr1 is greater than or equal to c-addr2 and caddr2 is less than the quantity c-addr1 u CHARS +), memory propagation occurs.
Typical use: Assume a character string at address 100: “ABCD”. Then after   100 DUP CHAR+ SWAP 3 CMOVE> the string at address 100 is “DDDD”.

#### A.17.6.1.0935 COMPARE 

Existing Forth systems perform string comparison operations using words that differ in spelling, input and  output arguments, and case sensitivity. One in widespread use was chosen.

#### A.17.6.1.2191 SEARCH 

Existing Forth systems perform string searching operations using words that differ in spelling, input and  output arguments, and case sensitivity. One in widespread use was chosen.

The standards referenced in this section were developed by the Forth Standards Team, a volunteer group  which included both implementors and users. This was a volunteer organization operating under its own  charter and without any formal ties to ANSI, IEEE or any similar standards body. Several members of the  Forth Standards Team have also been members of the X3J14 Technical Committee.

C. Perspective (informative annex)  The purpose of this section is to provide an informal overview of Forth as a language, illustrating its history,  most prominent features, usage, and common implementation techniques. Nothing in this section should be  considered as binding upon either implementors or users. A list of books and articles is given in Annex B for those interested in learning more about Forth.
