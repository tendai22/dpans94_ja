# D.4 Recent developments 

Since the Forth-83 Standard was published, the computer industry has undergone rapid and profound  changes. The speed, memory capacity, and disk capacity of affordable personal computers have increased  by factors of more than 100. 8-bit processors have given way to 16-bit processors, and now 32-bit  processors are commonplace.
The operating systems and programming-language environments of small systems are much more powerful  than they were in the early 80’s.
The personal-computer marketplace has changed from a predominantly “hobbyist” market to a mature  business and commercial market.
Improved technology for designing custom microprocessors has resulted in the design of numerous “Forth  chips”, computers optimized for the execution of the Forth language.
The market for ROM-based embedded control computers has grown substantially.
In order to take full advantage of this evolving technology, and to better compete with other programming  languages, many recent Forth implementations have ignored some of the “rules” of previous Forth  standards. In particular:  – 32-bit Forth implementations are now common.
– Some Forth systems adopt the address-alignment restrictions of the hardware on which they run.
– Some Forth systems use native-code generation, microcode generation, and optimization techniques, 
rather than the traditional “threaded code”.
– Some Forth systems exploit segmented addressing architectures, placing portions of the Forth 
“dictionary” in different segments.
– More and more Forth systems now run in the environment of another “standard” operating system, 
using OS text files for source code, rather than the traditional Forth “blocks”.
– Some Forth systems allow external operating system software, windowing software, terminal 
concentrators, or communications channels to handle or preprocess user input, resulting in deviations  from the input editing, character set availability, and screen management behavior prescribed by  Forth 83.
Competitive pressure from other programming languages (predominantly “C”) and from other Forth  vendors have led Forth vendors to optimizations that do not fit in well with the “virtual machine model”  implied by existing Forth standards.
