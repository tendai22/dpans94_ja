# D.2 Forth 79 

The Forth-79 Standard resulted from a series of meetings from 1978 to 1980, by the Forth Standards Team,  an international group of Forth users and vendors (interim versions known as Forth 77 and Forth 78 were  also released by the group).
Forth 79 described a set of words defined on a 16-bit, twos-complement, unaligned, linear byte-addressing  virtual machine. It prescribed an implementation technique known as “indirect threaded code”, and used the  ASCII character set.
The Forth-79 Standard served as the basis for several public domain and commercial implementations,  some of which are still available and supported today.
