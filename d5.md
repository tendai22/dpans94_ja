# D.5 ANS Forth approach 

The ANS Forth committee addressed the serious fragmentation of the Forth community caused by the  differences between Forth 79 and Forth 83, and the divergence from either of these two industry standards  caused by marketplace pressures.
Consequently, the committee has chosen to base its compatibility decisions not upon a strict comparison  with the Forth-83 Standard, but instead upon consideration of the variety of existing implementations,  especially those with substantial user bases and/or considerable success in the marketplace.
The committee feels that, if ANS Forth prescribes stringent requirements upon the virtual machine model,  as did the previous standards, then many implementors will chose not to comply with ANS Forth. The  committee hopes that ANS Forth will serve to unify rather than to further divide the Forth community, and  thus has chosen to encompass rather than invalidate popular implementation techniques.
Many of the changes from Forth 83 are justified by this rationale. Most fall into the category that “an ANS  Forth Standard Program may not assume x”, where “x” is an entitlement resulting from the virtual machine  model prescribed by the Forth-83 Standard. The committee feels that these restrictions are reasonable,  especially considering that a substantial number of existing Forth implementations do not correctly  implement the Forth-83 virtual model, thus the Forth-83 entitlements exist “in theory” but not “in practice”.
Another way of looking at this is that while ANS Forth acknowledges the diversity of current Forth practice,  it attempts to document the similarity therein. In some sense, ANS Forth is thus a “description of reality”  rather than a “prescription for a particular virtual machine”.
Since there is no previous American National Standard for Forth, the action requirements prescribed by  section 3.4 of X3/SD-9, “Policy and Guidelines”, regarding previous standards do not apply.
The following discussion describes differences between ANS Forth and Forth 83. In most cases, Forth 83 is  representative of Forth 79 and FIG Forth for the purposes of this discussion. In many of these cases,  however, ANS Forth is more representative of the existing state of the Forth industry than the previouslypublished standards.
