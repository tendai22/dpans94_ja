# A.7 The optional Block word set 

For two’s-complement machines that ignore arithmetic overflow (most machines), the following  implementation works in all cases:  Typical use: : name2 ... [COMPILE] name1 ... ; IMMEDIATE Typical use: 5 CONSTANT THAT \ THIS IS A COMMENT ABOUT THAT Early Forth systems ran stand-alone, with no host OS. Blocks of 1024 bytes were designed as a convenient  unit of disk, and most native Forth systems still use them. It is relatively easy to write a native disk driver  that maps head/track/sector addresses to block numbers. Such disk drivers are extremely fast in comparison  with conventional file-oriented operating systems, and security is high because there is no reliance on a disk  map.
Today many Forth implementations run under host operating systems, because the compatibility they offer  the user outweighs the performance overhead. Many people who use such systems prefer using host OS  files only; however, people who use both native and non-native Forths need a compatible way of accessing  disk. The Block Word set includes the most common words for accessing program source and data on disk.
In order to guarantee that Standard Programs that need access to mass storage have a mechanism  appropriate for both native and non-native implementations, ANS Forth requires that the Block word set be  available if any mass storage facilities are provided. On non-native implementations, blocks normally  reside in host OS files.

## A.7.2 Additional terms 

block  Many Forth systems use blocks to contain program source. Conventionally such blocks are formatted for  editing as 16 lines of 64 characters. Source blocks are often referred to as “screens”.
