# C.3 Hardware implementations of Forth 

The internal architecture of Forth simulates a computer with two stacks, a set of registers, and other  standardized features. As a result, it was almost inevitable that someone would attempt to build a hardware  representation of an actual Forth computer.
In the early 1980’s, Rockwell produced a 6502-variant with Forth primitives in on-board ROM, the  Rockwell 65F11. This chip has been used successfully in many embedded microprocessor applications. In  the mid-1980’s Zilog developed the z8800 (Super8) which offered ENTER (nest), EXIT (unnest) and  NEXT in microcode.
In 1981, Moore undertook to design a chip-level implementation of the Forth virtual machine. Working  first at FORTH, Inc. and subsequently with the start-up company NOVIX, formed to develop the chip,  Moore completed the design in 1984, and the first prototypes were produced in early 1985. More recently,  Forth processors have been developed by Harris Semiconductor Corp., Johns Hopkins University, and  others.
