## A.1.1 Purpose 


## A.1.2 Scope 

– the desire to resolve conflicts between previous standards; 
– the need to eliminate semantic ambiguities and other inadequacies; 
– the requirement to standardize common practice, where possible resolving divergences in a way that 
None  A. Rationale (informative annex)  This Standard is more extensive than previous industry standards for the Forth language. Several things  made this necessary:  minimizes the cost of compliance;  – the desire to standardize common system techniques, including those germane to hardware.
The result of the effort to satisfy all of these objectives is a Standard arranged so that the required word set  remains small. Thus ANS Forth can be provided for resource-constrained embedded systems. Words  beyond those in the required word set are organized into a number of optional word sets and their  extensions, enabling implementation of tailored systems that are Standard.
When judging relative merits, the members of the X3J14 Technical Committee were guided by the  following goals (listed in alphabetic order):  Consistency The Standard provides a functionally complete set of words with minimal  functional overlap.
Cost of compliance This goal includes such issues as common practice, how much existing code  would be broken by the proposed change, and the amount of effort required to  bring existing applications and systems into conformity with the Standard.
Efficiency Execution speed, memory compactness.
Portability Words chosen for inclusion should be free of system-dependent features.
Readability Forth definition names should clearly delineate their behavior. That behavior  should have an apparent simplicity which supports rapid understanding. Forth  should be easily taught and support readily maintained code.
Utility Be judged to have sufficiently essential functionality and frequency of use to be  deemed suitable for inclusion.

### A.1.3.1 Word sets 

From the beginning, the X3J14 Technical Committee faced not only conflicting ideas as to what “real”  Forth is, but also conflicting needs of the various groups within the Forth community. At one extreme were  those who pressed for a “bare” Forth. At the other extreme were those who wanted a “fat” Forth. Many  were somewhere in between. All were convinced of the rightness of their own position and of the  wrongness of at least one of the two extremes. The committee’s composition reflected this full range of  interests.
The approach we have taken is to define a Core word set establishing a greatest lower bound for required  system functionality and to provide a portfolio of optional word sets for special purposes. This simple  approach parallels the fundamental nature of Forth as an extensible language, and thereby achieves a kind of  meta-extensibility.
With this key, high-level compromise, regardless of the actual makeup of the individual word sets, a firm  and workable framework is established for the long term. One may or may not agree that there should be a  Locals word set, or that the word COMPILE, belongs in the Core Extensions word set. But at least there is  a mechanism whereby such things can be included in a logical and orderly manner.
Several implications of this scheme of optional word sets are significant.
First, ANS Forth systems can continue to be implemented on a greater range of hardware than could be  claimed by almost any other single language. Since only the Core word set is required, very limited  hardware will be able to accommodate an ANS Forth implementation.
Second, a greater degree of portability of applications, and of programmers, is anticipated. The optional  word sets standardize various functions (e.g., floating point) that were widely implemented before, but not  with uniform definition names and methodologies, nor the same levels of completeness. With such words  now standardized in the optional word sets, communications between programmers – verbally, via magazine  or journal articles, etc. – will leap to a new level of facility, and the shareability of code and applications  should rise dramatically.
Third, ANS Forth systems may be designed to offer the user the power to selectively, even dynamically,  include or exclude one or more of the optional word sets or portions thereof. Also, lower-priced products  may be offered for the user who needs the Core word set and not much more. Thus, virtually unlimited  flexibility will be available to the user.
But these advantages have a price. The burden is on the user to decide what capabilities are desired, and to  select product offerings accordingly, especially when portability of applications is important. We do not  expect most implementors to attempt to provide all word sets, but rather to select those most valuable to  their intended markets.
The basic requirement is that if the implementor claims to have a particular optional word set the entire  required portion of that word set must be available. If the implementor wishes to offer only part of an  optional word set, it is acceptable to say, for example, “This system offers portions of the [named] word  set”, particularly if the selected or excluded words are itemized clearly.
Each optional word set will probably appeal to a particular constituency. For example, scientists  performing complex mathematical analysis may place a higher value on the Floating-Point word set than  programmers developing simple embedded controllers. As in the case of the core extensions, we expect  implementors to offer those word sets they expect will be valued by their users.
Optional word sets may be offered in source form or otherwise factored so that the user may selectively load  them.
The extensions to the optional word sets include words which are deemed less essential to performing the  primary activity supported by the word set, though clearly relevant to it. As in the case of the Core  Extensions, implementors may selectively add itemized subsets of a word set extension providing the  labeling doesn’t mislead the user into thinking incorrectly that all words are present.
