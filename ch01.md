AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD ANSI X3.215-1994  American National Standard  for Information Systems —  Programming Language —  Forth  

The purpose of this Standard is to promote the portability of Forth programs for use on a wide variety of  computing systems, to facilitate the communication of programs, programming techniques, and ideas among  Forth programmers, and to serve as a basis for the future evolution of the Forth language.

## 1.2 Scope 

This Standard specifies an interface between a Forth System and a Forth Program by defining the words  provided by a Standard System.

### 1.2.1 Inclusions 

– the forms that a program written in the Forth language may take; 
This Standard specifies:  – the rules for interpreting the meaning of a program and its data.

### 1.2.2 Exclusions 

– the mechanism by which programs are transformed for use on computing systems; 
– the operations required for setup and control of the use of programs on computing systems; 
– the method of transcription of programs or their input or output data to or from a storage medium; 
– the program and Forth system behavior when the rules of this Standard fail to establish an 
– the size or complexity of a program and its data that will exceed the capacity of any specific computing 
– the physical properties of input/output records, files, and units; 
This Standard does not specify:  interpretation;  system or the capability of a particular Forth system;  – the physical properties and implementation of storage.

## 1.3 Document organization 


### 1.3.1 Word sets 

This Standard groups Forth words and capabilities into word sets under a name indicating some shared  aspect, typically their common functional area. Each word set may have an extension, containing words that  offer additional functionality. These words are not required in an implementation of the word set.
The “Core” word set, defined in sections 1 through 6, contains the required words and capabilities of a  Standard System. The other word sets, defined in sections 7 through 17, are optional, making it possible to  provide Standard Systems with tailored levels of functionality.

#### 1.3.1.1 Text sections 

Within each word set, section 1 contains introductory and explanatory material and section 2 introduces  terms and notation used throughout the Standard. There are no requirements in these sections.
Sections 3 and 4 contain the usage and documentation requirements, respectively, for Standard Systems and  Programs, while section 5 specifies their labeling.

#### 1.3.1.2 Glossary sections 

Section 6 of each word set specifies the required behavior of the definitions in the word set and the  extensions word set.

### 1.3.2 Annexes 

The annexes do not contain any required material.
Annex A provides some of the rationale behind the committee’s decisions in creating this Standard, as well  as implementation examples. It has the same section numbering as the body of the Standard to make it easy  to relate each requirements section to its rationale section.
Annex B is a short bibliography on Forth.
Annex C provides an introduction to Forth.
Annex D discusses the compatibility of ANS Forth with earlier Forths, emphasizing the differences from  Forth 83.
Annex E presents some techniques for writing portable programs in ANS Forth.
Annex F includes the words from all word sets in a single list, and serves as an index of ANS Forth words.

## 1.4 Future directions 


### 1.4.1 New technology 

This Standard adopts certain words and practices that are increasingly found in common practice. New  words have also been adopted to ease creation of portable programs.

### 1.4.2 Obsolescent features 

This Standard adopts certain words and practices that cause some previously used words to become  obsolescent. Although retained here because of their widespread use, their use in new implementations or  new programs is discouraged, because they may be withdrawn from future revisions of the Standard.
