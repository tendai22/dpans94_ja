# Rationale (informative annex)

## A.1 Introduction 


### A.1.1 Purpose 


### A.1.2 Scope 

This Standard is more extensive than previous industory standards for the Forth language.  Several things made this necessary:

- the desire to resolve conflicts between previous standards; 
- the need to eliminate semantic ambiguities and other inadequacies; 
- the requirement to standardize common practice, where possible resolving divergences in a way that minimizes the cost of compliance;
- the desire to standardize common system techniques, including those germane to hardware.

The result of the effort to satisfy all of these objectives is a Standard arranged so that the required word set  remains small. Thus ANS Forth can be provided for resource-constrained embedded systems. Words  beyond those in the required word set are organized into a number of optional word sets and their  extensions, enabling implementation of tailored systems that are Standard.

When judging relative merits, the members of the X3J14 Technical Committee were guided by the  following goals (listed in alphabetic order):

<description>
||Consistency||The Standard provides a functionally complete set of words with minimal  functional overlap.

||Cost of compliance||This goal includes such issues as common practice, how much existing code  would be broken by the proposed change, and the amount of effort required to  bring existing applications and systems into conformity with the Standard.

||Efficiency||Execution speed, memory compactness.

||Portability||Words chosen for inclusion should be free of system-dependent features.

||Readability||Forth definition names should clearly delineate their behavior. That behavior  should have an apparent simplicity which supports rapid understanding. Forth  should be easily taught and support readily maintained code.

||Utility||Be judged to have sufficiently essential functionality and frequency of use to be  deemed suitable for inclusion.

### A.1.3 Document organization 

#### A.1.3.1 Word sets 

From the beginning, the X3J14 Technical Committee faced not only conflicting ideas as to what "real"  Forth is, but also conflicting needs of the various groups within the Forth community. At one extreme were  those who pressed for a "bare" Forth. At the other extreme were those who wanted a "fat" Forth. Many  were somewhere in between. All were convinced of the rightness of their own position and of the  wrongness of at least one of the two extremes. The committee’s composition reflected this full range of  interests.

The approach we have taken is to define a Core word set establishing a greatest lower bound for required  system functionality and to provide a portfolio of optional word sets for special purposes. This simple  approach parallels the fundamental nature of Forth as an extensible language, and thereby achieves a kind of  meta-extensibility.

With this key, high-level compromise, regardless of the actual makeup of the individual word sets, a firm  and workable framework is established for the long term. One may or may not agree that there should be a  Locals word set, or that the word COMPILE, belongs in the Core Extensions word set. But at least there is  a mechanism whereby such things can be included in a logical and orderly manner.

Several implications of this scheme of optional word sets are significant.

First, ANS Forth systems can continue to be implemented on a greater range of hardware than could be  claimed by almost any other single language. Since only the Core word set is required, very limited  hardware will be able to accommodate an ANS Forth implementation.

Second, a greater degree of portability of applications, and of programmers, is anticipated. The optional  word sets standardize various functions (e.g., floating point) that were widely implemented before, but not  with uniform definition names and methodologies, nor the same levels of completeness. With such words  now standardized in the optional word sets, communications between programmers - verbally, via magazine  or journal articles, etc. - will leap to a new level of facility, and the shareability of code and applications  should rise dramatically.

Third, ANS Forth systems may be designed to offer the user the power to selectively, even dynamically,  include or exclude one or more of the optional word sets or portions thereof. Also, lower-priced products  may be offered for the user who needs the Core word set and not much more. Thus, virtually unlimited  flexibility will be available to the user.

But these advantages have a price. The burden is on the user to decide what capabilities are desired, and to  select product offerings accordingly, especially when portability of applications is important. We do not  expect most implementors to attempt to provide all word sets, but rather to select those most valuable to  their intended markets.

The basic requirement is that if the implementor claims to have a particular optional word set the entire  required portion of that word set must be available. If the implementor wishes to offer only part of an  optional word set, it is acceptable to say, for example, "This system offers portions of the [named] word  set", particularly if the selected or excluded words are itemized clearly.

Each optional word set will probably appeal to a particular constituency. For example, scientists  performing complex mathematical analysis may place a higher value on the Floating-Point word set than  programmers developing simple embedded controllers. As in the case of the core extensions, we expect  implementors to offer those word sets they expect will be valued by their users.

Optional word sets may be offered in source form or otherwise factored so that the user may selectively load  them.

The extensions to the optional word sets include words which are deemed less essential to performing the  primary activity supported by the word set, though clearly relevant to it. As in the case of the Core  Extensions, implementors may selectively add itemized subsets of a word set extension providing the  labeling doesn’t mislead the user into thinking incorrectly that all words are present.

## A.2 Terms and notation 


### A.2.1 Definitions of terms 


<miniterm>
||ambiguous condition||
The response of a Standard System to an ambiguous condition is left to the discretion of the implementor.
A Standard System need not explicitly detect or report the occurrence of ambiguous conditions.

||cross compiler||
Cross-compilers may be used to prepare a program for execution in an embedded system, or may be used to  generate Forth kernels either for the same or a different run-time environment.

||data field||
In earlier standards, data fields were known as "parameter fields".
On subroutine threaded Forth systems, everything is object code. There are no traditional code or data  fields. Only a word defined by CREATE or by a word that calls CREATE has a data field. Only a data field  defined via CREATE can be manipulated portably.

||word set||
This Standard recognizes that some functions, while useful in certain application areas, are not sufficiently  general to justify requiring them in all Forth systems. Further, it is helpful to group Forth words according  to related functions. These issues are dealt with using the concept of word sets.

The "Core" word set contains the essential body of words in a Forth system. It is the only "required" word  set. Other word sets defined in this Standard are optional additions to make it possible to provide Standard  Systems with tailored levels of functionality.

</miniterm>

### A.2.2 Notation 

#### A.2.2.2 Stack notation 

The use of *-sys*, *orig*, and *dest* data types in stack effect diagrams conveys two pieces of information. First,  it warns the reader that many implementations use the data stack in unspecified ways for those purposes, so  that items underneath on either the control-flow or data stacks are unavailable. Second, in cases where orig and dest are used, explicit pairing rules are documented on the assumption that all systems will implement  that model so that its results are equivalent to employment of some stack, and that in fact many  implementations do use the data stack for this purpose. However, nothing in this Standard requires that  implementations actually employ the data stack (or any other) for this purpose so long as the implied  behavior of the model is maintained.

## A.3 Usage requirements 

Forth systems are unusually simple to develop, in comparison with compilers for more conventional  languages such as C. In addition to Forth systems supported by vendors, public-domain implementations  and implementation guides have been widely available for nearly twenty years, and a large number of  individuals have developed their own Forth systems. As a result, a variety of implementation approaches  have developed, each optimized for a particular platform or target market.

The X3J14 Technical Committee has endeavored to accommodate this diversity by constraining  implementors as little as possible, consistent with a goal of defining a standard interface between an  underlying Forth System and an application program being developed on it.

Similarly, we will not undertake in this section to tell you how to implement a Forth System, but rather will  provide some guidance as to what the minimum requirements are for systems that can properly claim  compliance with this Standard.

### A.3.1 Data-types 

Most computers deal with arbitrary bit patterns. There is no way to determine by inspection whether a cell  contains an address or an unsigned integer. The only meaning a datum possesses is the meaning assigned by  an application.

When data are operated upon, the meaning of the result depends on the meaning assigned to the input  values. Some combinations of input values produce meaningless results: for instance, what meaning can be  assigned to the arithmetic sum of the ASCII representation of the character "A" and a TRUE flag? The  answer may be "no meaning"; or alternatively, that operation might be the first step in producing a  checksum. Context is the determiner.

The discipline of circumscribing meaning which a program may assign to various combinations of bit  patterns is sometimes called data typing. Many computer languages impose explicit data typing and have  compilers that prevent ill-defined operations.

Forth rarely explicitly imposes data-type restrictions. Still, data types implicitly do exist, and discipline is  required, particularly if portability of programs is a goal. In Forth, it is incumbent upon the programmer  (rather than the compiler) to determine that data are accurately typed.
This section attempts to offer guidance regarding de facto data typing in Forth.

#### A.3.1.2 Character types 

The correct identification and proper manipulation of the character data type is beyond the purview of  Forth’s enforcement of data type by means of stack depth. Characters do not necessarily occupy the entire  width of their single stack entry with meaningful data. While the distinction between signed and unsigned  character is entirely absent from the formal specification of Forth, the tendency in practice is to treat  characters as short positive integers when mathematical operations come into play.

##### a) Standard Character Set

<itemize>

1) The storage unit for the character data type (C@, C!, FILL, etc.) must be able to contain unsigned numbers from 0 through 255.

2) An implementation is not required to restrict character storage to that range, but a Standard Program without environmental dependencies cannot assume the ability to store numbers outside that range in a  "char" location.

3) The allowed number representations are two’s-complement, one’s-complement, and signed-magnitude.  Note that all of these number systems agree on the representation of positive numbers.

4) Since a "char" can store small positive numbers and since the character data type is a sub-range of the unsigned integer data type, `C!` must store the n least-significant bits of a cell (8 &le; n &lt;= bits/cell).  Given  the enumeration of allowed number representations and their known encodings, "`TRUE xx C! xx C@`"  must leave a stack item with some number of bits set, which will thus will be accepted as non-zero by IF.

5) For the purposes of input (KEY, ACCEPT, etc.) and output (EMIT, TYPE, etc.), the encoding between numbers and human-readable symbols is ISO646/IRV (ASCII) within the range from 32 to 126 (space to ~).  EBCDIC is out (most "EBCDIC" computer systems support ASCII too). Outside that range, it is up to the  implementation. The obvious implementation choice is to use ASCII control characters for the range from 0  to 31, at least for the "displayable" characters in that range (TAB, RETURN, LINEFEED, FORMFEED).  However, this is not as clear-cut as it may seem, because of the variation between operating systems on the  treatment of those characters. For example, some systems TAB to 4 character boundaries, others to 8  character boundaries, and others to preset tab stops. Some systems perform an automatic linefeed after a  carriage return, others perform an automatic carriage return after a linefeed, and others do neither.

The codes from 128 to 255 may eventually be standardized, either formally or informally, for use as  international characters, such as the letters with diacritical marks found in many European languages. One  such encoding is the 8-bit ISO Latin-1 character set. The computer marketplace at large will eventually  decide which encoding set of those characters prevails. For Forth implementations running under an  operating system (the majority of those running on standard platforms these days), most Forth implementors  will probably choose to do whatever the system does, without performing any remapping within the domain  of the Forth system itself.

6) A Standard Program can depend on the ability to receive any character in the range 32 ... 126 through `KEY`, and similarly to display the same set of characters with `EMIT`. If a program must be able to receive or  display any particular character outside that range, it can declare an environmental dependency on the  ability to receive or display that character.

7) A Standard Program cannot use control characters in definition names. However, a Standard System is not required to enforce this prohibition. Thus, existing systems that currently allow control characters in  words names from `BLOCK` source may continue to allow them, and programs running on those systems will  continue to work. In text file source, the parsing action with space as a delimiter (e.g., `BL` `WORD`) treats  control characters the same as spaces. This effectively implies that you cannot use control characters in  definition names from text-file source, since the text interpreter will treat the control characters as  delimiters. Note that this "control-character folding" applies only when space is the delimiter, thus the  phrase "`CHAR ) WORD`" may collect a string containing control characters.

</itemize>

##### b) Storage and retrieval 

Characters are transferred from the data stack to memory by `C!` and from memory to the data stack by `C@`.  A number of lower-significance bits equivalent to the implementation-dependent width of a character are  transferred from a popped data stack entry to an address by the action of `C!` without affecting any bits  which may comprise the higher-significance portion of the cell at the destination address; however, the  action of `C@` clears all higher-significance bits of the data stack entry which it pushes that are beyond the  implementation-dependent width of a character (which may include implementation-defined display  information in the higher-significance bits). The programmer should keep in mind that operating upon  arbitrary stack entries with words intended for the character data type may result in truncation of such data.

c) Manipulation on the stack 

In addition to C@ and C!, characters are moved to, from and upon the data stack by the following words:  

    >R ?DUP DROP DUP OVER PICK R> R@ ROLL ROT SWAP 

##### d) Additional operations  

    + - * / /MOD MOD 

The following mathematical operators are valid for character data:  The following comparison and bitwise operators may be valid for characters, keeping in mind that display  information cached in the most significant bits of characters in an implementation-defined fashion may have  to be masked or otherwise dealt with:  

    AND OR > < U> U< = <> 0= 0<> MAX MIN  LSHIFT RSHIFT  

#### A.3.1.3 Single-cell types 

A single-cell stack entry viewed without regard to typing is the fundamental data type of Forth. All other  data types are actually represented by one or more single-cell stack entries.

##### a) Storage and retrieval 

Single-cell data are transferred from the stack to memory by !; from memory to the stack by @. All bits are  transferred in both directions and no type checking of any sort is performed, nor does the Standard System  check that a memory address used by ! or @ is properly aligned or properly sized to hold the datum thus  transferred.

##### b) Manipulation on the stack  

Here is a selection of the most important words which move single-cell data to, from and upon the data  stack:  

    ! @ >R ?DUP DROP DUP OVER PICK R> R@ ROLL ROT SWAP 

##### c) Comparison operators

The following comparison operators are universally valid for one or more single cells:  

    = <> 0= 0<> 

##### A.3.1.3.1 Flags 

A `FALSE` flag is a single-cell datum with all bits unset, and a `TRUE` flag is a single-cell datum with all bits  set. While Forth words which test flags accept any non-null bit pattern as true, there exists the concept of the  well-formed flag. If an operation whose result is to be used as a flag may produce any bit-mask other than  `TRUE` or `FALSE`, the recommended discipline is to convert the result to a well-formed flag by means of the  Forth word `0<>` so that the result of any subsequent logical operations on the flag will be predictable.

In addition to the words which move, fetch and store single-cell items, the following words are valid for  operations on one or more flag data residing on the data stack:  

    AND OR XOR INVERT  

##### A.3.1.3.2 Integers 

A single-cell datum may be treated by a Standard Program as a signed integer. Moving and storing such  data is performed as for any single-cell data. In addition to the universally-applicable operators for single-cell data specified above, the following mathematical and comparison operators are valid for single-cell  signed integers:  

    * */ */MOD /MOD MOD + +! - / 1+ 1- ABS MAX MIN NEGATE 
    0< 0> < > 

Given the same number of bits, unsigned integers usually represent twice the number of absolute values  representable by signed integers.

A single-cell datum may be treated by a Standard Program as an unsigned integer. Moving and storing such  data is performed as for any single-cell data. In addition, the following mathematical and comparison  operators are valid for single-cell unsigned integers:  

    UM* UM/MOD + +! - 1+ 1- * U< U>  

##### A.3.1.3.3 Addresses 

An address is uniquely represented as a single cell unsigned number and can be treated as such when being  moved to, from, or upon the stack. Conversely, each unsigned number represents a unique address (which  is not necessarily an address of accessible memory). This one-to-one relationship between addresses and  unsigned numbers forces an equivalence between address arithmetic and the corresponding operations on  unsigned numbers.

Several operators are provided specifically for address arithmetic:  

    CHAR+ CHARS CELL+ CELLS  

and, if the floating-point word set is present:  

    FLOAT+ FLOATS SFLOAT+ SFLOATS DFLOAT+ DFLOATS  

A Standard Program may never assume a particular correspondence between a Forth address and the  physical address to which it is mapped.

##### A.3.1.3.4 Counted strings 

The trend in ANS Forth is to move toward the consistent use of the "c-addr u" representation of strings on  the stack. The use of the alternate "address of counted string" stack representation is discouraged. The  traditional Forth words `WORD` and `FIND` continue to use the "address of counted string" representation for  historical reasons. The new word `C"` , added as a porting aid for existing programs, also uses the counted  string representation.

Counted strings remain useful as a way to store strings in memory. This use is not discouraged, but when  references to such strings appear on the stack, it is preferable to use the "*c-addr u*" representation.

##### A.3.1.3.5 Execution tokens 

The association between an execution token and a definition is static. Once made, it does not change with  changes in the search order or anything else. However it may not be unique, e.g., the phrases  

    `' 1+` and 
    `' CHAR+` 

might return the same value.

#### A.3.1.4 Cell-pair types 

##### a) Storage and retrieval

Two operators are provided to fetch and store cell pairs:  

    2@ 2!

##### b) Manipulation on the stack  

Additionally, these operators may be used to move cell pairs from, to and upon the stack:  

    2>R 2DROP 2DUP 2OVER 2R> 2SWAP 2ROT 

##### c) Comparison  

The following comparison operations are universally valid for cell pairs:  

    D= D0=  

##### A.3.1.4.1 Double-Cell Integers 

If a double-cell integer is to be treated as signed, the following comparison and mathematical operations are  valid:  

    D+ D- D< D0< DABS DMAX DMIN DNEGATE M*/ M+  

If a double-cell integer is to be treated as unsigned, the following comparison and mathematical operations  are valid:  

    D+ D- UM/MOD DU<  

##### A.3.1.4.2 Character strings 

See: **A.3.1.3.4 Counted Strings**.

### A.3.2 The Implementation environment 

#### A.3.2.1 Numbers 

Traditionally, Forth has been implemented on two’s-complement machines where there is a one-to-one  mapping of signed numbers to unsigned numbers - any single cell item can be viewed either as a signed or  unsigned number. Indeed, the signed representation of any positive number is identical to the equivalent  unsigned representation. Further, addresses are treated as unsigned numbers: there is no distinct pointer  type. Arithmetic ordering on two’s complement machines allows + and - to work on both signed and  unsigned numbers. This arithmetic behavior is deeply embedded in common Forth practice. As a  consequence of these behaviors, the likely ranges of signed and unsigned numbers for implementations  hosted on each of the permissible arithmetic architectures is:  

<table>

 |Arithmetic architecture|signed numbers|unsigned numbers  
 |--|--|--|
 |Two’s complement|-n-1 to n|0 to 2n+1  
 |One’s complement|-n to n|0 to n
 |Signed magnitude|-n to n|0 to n|
 
</table>

where *n* is the largest positive signed number. For all three architectures, signed numbers in the 0 to n range  are bitwise identical to the corresponding unsigned number. Note that unsigned numbers on a signed  magnitude machine are equivalent to signed non-negative numbers as a consequence of the forced  correspondence between addresses and unsigned numbers and of the required behavior of `+` and `-`.

For reference, these number representations may be defined by the way that `NEGATE` is implemented:  

    two’s complement: : `NEGATE INVERT 1+ ;` 
    one’s complement: : `NEGATE INVERT ;` 
    signed-magnitude: : `NEGATE HIGH-BIT XOR ;` 

where `HIGH-BIT` is a bit mask with only the most-significant bit set. Note that all of these number systems  agree on the representation of non-negative numbers.

Per **3.2.1.1  Internal number representation** and **6.1.0270  0=**, the implementor must ensure that no  standard or supported word return negative zero for any numeric (non-Boolean or flag) result. Many  existing programmer assumptions will be violated otherwise.

There is no requirement to implement circular unsigned arithmetic, nor to set the range of unsigned numbers  to the full size of a cell. There is historical precedent for limiting the range of u to that of +n, which is  permissible when the cell size is greater than 16 bits.

##### A.3.2.1.2 Digit conversion 

For example, an implementation might convert the characters "a" through "z" identically to the characters "A" through "Z", or it might treat the characters " [ " through "~" as additional digits with decimal values 36 through 71, respectively.

#### A.3.2.2 Arithmetic 

##### A.3.2.2.1 Integer division 

The Forth-79 Standard specifies that the signed division operators (`/`, `/MOD`, `MOD`, `*/MOD`, and `*/`) round  non-integer quotients towards zero (symmetric division). Forth 83 changed the semantics of these operators  to round towards negative infinity (floored division). Some in the Forth community have declined to  convert systems and applications from the Forth-79 to the Forth-83 divide. To resolve this issue, an ANS  Forth system is permitted to supply either floored or symmetric operators. In addition, ANS Forth systems  must provide a floored division primitive (`FM/MOD`), a symmetric division primitive (`SM/REM`), and a  mixed precision multiplication operator (`M*`).

This compromise protects the investment made in current Forth applications; Forth-79 and Forth-83  programs are automatically compliant with ANS Forth with respect to division. In practice, the rounding  direction rarely matters to applications. However, if a program requires a specific rounding direction, it can  use the floored division primitive `FM/MOD` or the symmetric division primitive `SM/REM` to construct a  division operator of the desired flavor. This simple technique can be used to convert Forth-79 and Forth-83  programs to ANS Forth without any analysis of the original programs.

##### A.3.2.2.2 Other integer operations 

Whether underflow occurs depends on the data-type of the result. For example, the phrase `1 2 -` underflows if the result is unsigned and produces the valid signed result -1.

#### A.3.2.3 Stacks 

The only data type in Forth which has concrete rather than abstract existence is the stack entry. Even this  primitive typing Forth only enforces by the hard reality of stack underflow or overflow. The programmer  must have a clear idea of the number of stack entries to be consumed by the execution of a word and the  number of entries that will be pushed back to a stack by the execution of a word. The observation of  anomalous occurrences on the data stack is the first line of defense whereby the programmer may recognize  errors in an application program. It is also worth remembering that multiple stack errors caused by  erroneous application code are frequently of equal and opposite magnitude, causing complementary (and  deceptive) results.

For these reasons and a host of other reasons, the one unambiguous, uncontroversial, and indispensable  programming discipline observed since the earliest days of Forth is that of providing a stack diagram for all  additions to the application dictionary with the exception of static constructs such as `VARIABLE`s and  `CONSTANT`s.

##### A.3.2.3.2 Control-flow stack 

The simplest use of control-flow words is to implement the basic control structures shown in figure A.1.

<figure>
<img width=400 src="img/fig-A1-the-basic-control-flow-patterns.png">
</figure>

In control flow every branch, or transfer of control, must terminate at some destination. A natural  implementation uses a stack to remember the origin of forward branches and the destination of backward  branches. At a minimum, only the location of each origin or destination must be indicated, although other  implementation-dependent information also may be maintained.

An origin is the location of the branch itself. A destination is where control would continue if the branch  were taken. A destination is needed to resolve the branch address for each origin, and conversely, if every  control-flow path is completed no unused destinations can remain.

With the addition of just three words (`AHEAD`, `CS-ROLL` and `CS-PICK`), the basic control-flow words  supply the primitives necessary to compile a variety of transportable control structures. The abilities  required are compilation of forward and backward conditional and unconditional branches and compile-time  management of branch origins and destinations. Table A.1 shows the desired behavior.

The requirement that control-flow words are properly balanced by other control-flow words makes  reasonable the description of a compile-time implementation-defined control-flow stack. There is no  prescription as to how the control-flow stack is implemented, e.g., data stack, linked list, special array.  Each element of the control-flow stack mentioned above is the same size.

<table>

Table A.1 - Compilation behavior of control-flow words  

 |at compile time,<br>word:|supplies:|resolves:|is used to:|
 |--|:--:|:--:|--|
 |`IF`|orig|| mark origin of forward conditional branch  
 |`THEN`||orig|resolve IF or AHEAD 
 |`BEGIN`|dest|| mark backward destination  
 |`AGAIN`|| dest|resolve with backward unconditional branch  
 |`UNTIL`|| dest|resolve with backward conditional branch  
 |`AHEAD`|orig||mark origin of forward unconditional branch  
 |`CS-PICK`||| copy item on control-flow stack  
 |`CS-ROLL`|||reorder items on control-flow stack
 
</table>

 With these tools, the remaining basic control-structure elements, shown in figure A.2, can be defined. The  stack notation used here for immediate words is ( compilation / execution ).

    : WHILE ( dest -- orig dest / flag -- ) 
        \ conditional exit from loops 
        POSTPONE IF \ conditional forward branch 
        1 CS-ROLL \ keep dest on top 
    ; IMMEDIATE 
    : REPEAT ( orig dest -- / -- ) 
        \ resolve a single WHILE and return to BEGIN 
        POSTPONE AGAIN \ uncond. backward branch to dest 
        POSTPONE THEN \ resolve forward branch from orig 
    ; IMMEDIATE 
    : ELSE ( orig1 -- orig2 / -- ) 
        \ resolve IF supplying alternate execution 
        POSTPONE AHEAD \ unconditional forward branch orig2 
        1 CS-ROLL \ put orig1 back on top 
        POSTPONE THEN \ resolve forward branch from orig1 
    ; IMMEDIATE 

<figure>
<img width=250 src="img/fig-A2-additional-control-flow-pattern.png">
<figcaption>Figure A.2 - Additional basic control-flow patterns.</figcaption>
</figure>

Forth control flow provides a solution for well-known problems with strictly structured programming.

The basic control structures can be supplemented, as shown in the examples in figure A.3, with additional  `WHILE`s in `BEGIN` ... `UNTIL` and `BEGIN` ... `WHILE` ... `REPEAT` structures. However, for  each additional `WHILE` there must be a `THEN` at the end of the structure. `THEN` completes the syntax with  `WHILE` and indicates where to continue execution when the `WHILE` transfers control. The use of more than  one additional `WHILE` is possible but not common. Note that if the user finds this use of THEN undesirable,  an alias with a more likable name could be defined.

Additional actions may be performed between the control flow word (the `REPEAT` or `UNTIL`) and the  `THEN` that matches the additional `WHILE`. Further, if additional actions are desired for normal termination  and early termination, the alternative actions may be separated by the ordinary Forth `ELSE`. The  termination actions are all specified after the body of the loop.

<figure>
<img width=250 src="img/fig-A3-extended-control-flow-pattern-examples.png" >
<figcaption>Figure A.3 - Extended control-flow pattern examples.</figcaption>
</figure>

Note that `REPEAT` creates an anomaly when matching the `WHILE` with `ELSE` or `THEN`, most notable when  compared with the `BEGIN`...`UNTIL` case. That is, there will be one less `ELSE` or `THEN` than there are  WHILEs because `REPEAT` resolves one `THEN`. As above, if the user finds this count mismatch undesirable,  `REPEAT` could be replaced in-line by its own definition.

Other loop-exit control-flow words, and even other loops, can be defined. The only requirements are that  the control-flow stack is properly maintained and manipulated.

The simple implementation of the ANS Forth `CASE` structure below is an example of control structure  extension. Note the maintenance of the data stack to prevent interference with the possible control-flow  stack usage.

    0 CONSTANT CASE IMMEDIATE ( init count of OFs ) 

    : OF    ( #of -- orig #of+1 / x -- ) 
         1+     ( count OFs ) 
         >R     ( move off the stack in case the control-flow ) 
                ( stack is the data stack. ) 
        POSTPONE OVER  POSTPONE =   ( copy and test case value) 
        POSTPONE IF                 ( add orig to control flow stack ) 
        POSTPONE DROP               ( discards case value if = ) 
        R>                          ( we can bring count back now ) 
    ; IMMEDIATE 

    : ENDOF ( orig1 #of -- orig2 #of ) 
        >R  ( move off the stack in case the control-flow ) 
            ( stack is the data stack. ) 
        POSTPONE ELSE 
        R>  ( we can bring count back now ) 
    ; IMMEDIATE 

    : ENDCASE ( orig1..orign #of -- ) 
        POSTPONE DROP ( discard case value ) 
        0 ?DO 
            POSTPONE THEN 
        LOOP 
    ; IMMEDIATE 

##### A.3.2.3.3 Return stack 

The restrictions in section **3.2.3.3  Return stack** are necessary if implementations are to be allowed to place  loop parameters on the return stack.

#### A.3.2.6 Environmental queries 

The size in address units of various data types may be determined by phrases such as 1 CHARS. Similarly,  alignment may be determined by phrases such as 1 ALIGNED.

The environmental queries are divided into two groups: those that always produce the same value and those  that might not. The former groups include entries such as MAX-N. This information is fixed by the  hardware or by the design of the Forth system; a user is guaranteed that asking the question once is  sufficient.

The other group of queries are for things that may legitimately change over time. For example an  application might test for the presence of the Double Number word set using an environment query. If it is  missing, the system could invoke a system-dependent process to load the word set. The system is permitted  to change `ENVIRONMENT?`'s database so that subsequent queries about it indicate that it is present.

Note that a query that returns an "unknown" response could produce a "known" result on a subsequent  query.

### A.3.3 The Forth dictionary 

A Standard Program may redefine a standard word with a non-standard definition. The program is still  Standard (since it can be built on any Standard System), but the effect is to make the combined entity  (Standard System plus Standard Program) a non-standard system.

#### A.3.3.1 Name space 

##### A.3.3.1.2 Definition names 

The language in this section is there to ensure the portability of Standard Programs. If a program uses  something outside the Standard that it does not provide itself, there is no guarantee that another  implementation will have what the program needs to run. There is no intent whatsoever to imply that all  Forth programs will be somehow lacking or inferior because they are not standard; some of the finest jewels  of the programmer’s art will be non-standard. At the same time, the committee is trying to ensure that a  program labeled "Standard" will meet certain expectations, particularly with regard to portability.

In many system environments the input source is unable to supply certain non-graphic characters due to  external factors, such as the use of those characters for flow control or editing. In addition, when  interpreting from a text file, the parsing function specifically treats non-graphic characters like spaces; thus  words received by the text interpreter will not contain embedded non-graphic characters. To allow  implementations in such environments to call themselves Standard, this minor restriction on Standard  Programs is necessary.

A Standard System is allowed to permit the creation of definition names containing non-graphic characters.  Historically, such names were used for keyboard editing functions and "invisible" words.

#### A.3.3.2 Code space 


#### A.3.3.3 Data space 

The words `#TIB`, `>IN`, `BASE`, `BLK`, `SCR`, `SOURCE`, `SOURCE-ID`, `STATE`, and `TIB` contain information  used by the Forth system in its operation and may be of use to the application. Any assumption made by the  application about data available in the Forth system it did not store other than the data just listed is an  environmental dependency.

There is no point in specifying (in the Standard) both what is and what is not addressable.

A Standard Program may NOT address:  

- Directly into the data or return stacks; 
- Into a definition’s data field if not stored by the application.

The read-only restrictions arise because some Forth systems run from ROM and some share I/O buffers with  other users or systems. Portable programs cannot know which areas are affected, hence the general  restrictions.

##### A.3.3.3.1 Address alignment 

Many processors have restrictions on the addresses that can be used by memory access instructions. For  example, on a Motorola 68000, 16-bit or 32-bit data can be accessed only at even addresses. Other  examples include RISC architectures where 16-bit data can be loaded or stored only at even addresses and  32-bit data only at addresses that are multiples of four.

An implementor of ANS Forth can handle these alignment restrictions in one of two ways. Forth’s memory  access words (@, !, +!, etc.) could be implemented in terms of smaller-width access instructions which  have no alignment restrictions. For example, on a 68000 Forth with 16-bit cells, @ could be implemented  with two 68000 byte-fetch instructions and a reassembly of the bytes into a 16-bit cell. Although this  conceals hardware restrictions from the programmer, it is inefficient, and may have unintended side effects  in some hardware environments. An alternate implementation of ANS Forth could define each memory access word using the native instructions that most closely match the word’s function. On a 68000 Forth  with 16-bit cells, @ would use the 68000’s 16-bit move instruction. In this case, responsibility for giving @ a  correctly-aligned address falls on the programmer. A portable ANS Forth program must assume that  alignment may be required and follow the requirements of this section.

##### A.3.3.3.2 Contiguous regions 

The data space of a Forth system comes in discontinuous regions! The location of some regions is provided  by the system, some by the program. Data space is contiguous within regions, allowing address arithmetic  to generate valid addresses only within a single region. A Standard Program cannot make any assumptions  about the relative placement of multiple regions in memory.

Section **3.3.3.2**  does prescribe conditions under which contiguous regions of data space may be obtained.

For example:  

    CREATE TABLE 1 C, 2 C, ALIGN 1000 , 2000 ,  

makes a table whose address is returned by TABLE. In accessing this table,  

    TABLE C@                            will return 1  
    TABLE CHAR+ C@                      will return 2  
    TABLE 2 CHARS + ALIGNED @           will return 1000  
    TABLE 2 CHARS + ALIGNED CELL+ @     will return 2000.

Similarly,  

    CREATE DATA 1000 ALLOT  

makes an array 1000 address units in size. A more portable strategy would define the array in application  units, such as:      

    500 CONSTANT NCELLS 
    CREATE CELL-DATA NCELLS CELLS ALLOT  

This array can be indexed like this:  

    : LOOK NCELLS 0 DO CELL-DATA I CELLS + ? LOOP ; 

##### A.3.3.3.6 Other transient regions 

In many existing Forth systems, these areas are at `HERE` or just beyond it, hence the many restrictions.

(2**n*)+2 is the size of a character string containing the unpunctuated binary representation of the maximum double number with a leading minus sign and a trailing space.

Implementation note: Since the minimum value of *n* is 16, the absolute minimum size of the pictured  numeric output string is 34 characters. But if your implementation has a larger *n*, you must also increase the  size of the pictured numeric output string.

### A.3.4 The Forth text interpreter 

#### A.3.4.3 Semantics 

The "initiation semantics" correspond to the code that is executed upon entering a definition, analogous to  the code executed by `EXIT` upon leaving a definition. The "run-time semantics" correspond to code  fragments, such as literals or branches, that are compiled inside colon definitions by words with explicit  compilation semantics.

In a Forth cross-compiler, the execution semantics may be specified to occur in the host system only, the  target system only, or in both systems. For example, it may be appropriate for words such as `CELLS` to  execute on the host system returning a value describing the target, for colon definitions to execute only on  the target, and for `CONSTANT` and `VARIABLE` to have execution behaviors on both systems. Details of  cross-compiler behavior are beyond the scope of this Standard.

##### A.3.4.3.2 Interpretation semantics 

For a variety of reasons, this Standard does not define interpretation semantics for every word. Examples of  these words are `>R`, `."`, `DO`, and `IF`. Nothing in this Standard precludes an implementation from providing  interpretation semantics for these words, such as interactive control-flow words. However, a Standard  Program may not use them in interpretation state.

#### A.3.4.5 Compilation 

Compiler recursion at the definition level consumes excessive resources, especially to support locals. The  Technical Committee does not believe that the benefits justify the costs. Nesting definitions is also not  common practice and won’t work on many systems.

## A.4 Documentation requirements 


### A.4.1 System documentation 


### A.4.2 Program documentation 


## A.5 Compliance and labeling 

### A.5.1 ANS Forth systems 

Section 5.1 defines the criteria that a system must meet in order to justify the label "ANS Forth System".  Briefly, the minimum requirement is that the system must "implement" the Core word set. There are several  ways in which this requirement may be met. The most obvious is that all Core words may be in a pre-compiled kernel. This is not the only way of satisfying the requirement, however. For example, some  words may be provided in source blocks or files with instructions explaining how to add them to the system  if they are needed. So long as the words are provided in such a way that the user can obtain access to them  with a clear and straightforward procedure, they may be considered to be present.

A Forth cross-compiler has many characteristics in common with an ANS Forth System, in that both use  similar compiling tools to process a program. However, in order to fully specify an ANS Forth cross  compiler it would be necessary to address complex issues dealing with compilation and execution semantics  in both host and target environments as well as ROMability issues. The level of effort to do this properly  has proved to be impractical at this time. As a result, although it may be possible for a Forth cross-compiler  to correctly prepare an ANS Forth program for execution in a target environment, it is inappropriate for a  cross-compiler to be labeled an ANS Forth System.

### A.5.2 ANS Forth programs 

#### A.5.2.2 Program labeling 

Declaring an environmental dependency should not be considered undesirable, merely an acknowledgment  that the author has taken advantage of some assumed architecture. For example, most computers in  common use are based on two’s complement binary arithmetic. By acknowledging an environmental  dependency on this architecture, a programmer becomes entitled to use the number -1 to represent all bits  set without significantly restricting the portability of the program.

Because all programs require space for data and instructions, and time to execute those instructions, they  depend on the presence of an environment providing those resources. It is impossible to predict how little  of some of these resources (e.g. stack space) might be necessary to perform some task, so this Standard does  not do so.

On the other hand, as a program requires increasing levels of resources, there will probably be sucessively  fewer systems on which it will execute sucessfully. An algorithm requiring an array of 109 cells might run  on fewer computers than one requiring only 103.

Since there is also no way of knowing what minimum level of resources will be implemented in a system  useful for at least some tasks, any program performing real work labeled simply an "ANS Forth Program" is  unlikely to be labeled correctly.

## A.6 Glossary 

In this and following sections we present rationales for the handling of specific words: why we included  them, why we placed them in certain word sets, or why we specified their names or meaning as we did.

Words in this section are organized by word set, retaining their index numbers for easy cross-referencing to  the glossary.

Historically, many Forth systems have been written in Forth. Many of the words in Forth originally had as  their primary purpose support of the Forth system itself. For example, `WORD` and `FIND` are often used as  the principle instruments of the Forth text interpreter, and `CREATE` in many systems is the primitive for  building dictionary entries. In defining words such as these in a standard way, we have endeavored not to  do so in such a way as to preclude their use by implementors. One of the features of Forth that has endeared  it to its users is that the same tools that are used to implement the system are available to the application  programmer - a result of this approach is the compactness and efficiency that characterizes most Forth  implementations.

### A.6.1 Core words 

#### A.6.1.0070 `'` 

Typical use: `... ' name `.

Many Forth systems use a state-smart tick. Many do not. ANS Forth follows the usage of Forth 83.

**See: A.3.4.3..2 Interpretation semantics, A.6.1.1550 FIND**.

#### A.6.1.0080 `(` 

Typical use: `... ( ccc) ...`

#### A.6.1.0140 `+LOOP` 

Typical use:

    : X ... limit first DO ... step +LOOP ; 

#### A.6.1.0150 `,` 

Typical use:  

The use of , (comma) for compiling execution tokens is not portable.

See: **6.2.0945 COMPILE,**.

#### A.6.1.0190 ." 

Typical use: `: X ... ." ccc" ... ;` 

An implementation may define interpretation semantics for `."` if desired. In one plausible implementation,  interpreting `."` would display the delimited message. In another plausible implementation, interpreting `."` would compile code to display the message later. In still another plausible implementation, interpreting `."` would be treated as an exception. Given this variation a Standard Program may not use `."` while  interpreting. Similarly, a Standard Program may not compile `POSTPONE` `."` inside a new word, and then  use that word while interpreting.

#### A.6.1.0320 `2*` 

Historically, `2*` has been implemented on two's-complement machines as a logical left-shift instruction.  Multiplication by two is an efficient side-effect on these machines. However, shifting implies a knowledge  of the significance and position of bits in a cell. While the name implies multiplication, most implementors  have used a hardware left shift to implement `2*`.

#### A.6.1.0330 `2/` 

This word has the same common usage and misnaming implications as `2*`. It is often implemented on  two's-complement machines with a hardware right shift that propagates the sign bit.

#### A.6.1.0350 `2@` 

With `2@` the storage order is specified by the Standard.

#### A.6.1.0450 `:` 

Typical use: `: name ... ;` 

In Forth 83, this word was specified to alter the search order. This specification is explicitly removed in this  Standard. We believe that in most cases this has no effect; however, systems that allow many search orders  found the Forth-83 behavior of colon very undesirable.

Note that colon does not itself invoke the compiler. Colon sets compilation state so that later words in the  parse area are compiled.

#### A.6.1.0460 `;` 

Typical use: `: name ... ;` 

One function performed by both `;` and `;CODE` is to allow the current definition to be found in the  dictionary. If the current definition was created by `:NONAME` the current definition has no definition name  and thus cannot be found in the dictionary. If `:NONAME` is implemented the Forth compiler must maintain  enough information about the current definition to allow `;` and `;CODE` to determine whether or not any  action must be taken to allow it to be found.

#### A.6.1.0550 `>BODY` 

*a-addr* is the address that `HERE` would have returned had it been executed immediately after the execution  of the `CREATE` that defined *xt*.

#### A.6.1.0680 ABORT" 

Typical use: `: X ... test ABORT" ccc" ... ; `

#### A.6.1.0695 ACCEPT 

Previous standards specified that collection of the input string terminates when either a "return" is received  or when +n1 characters have been received. Terminating when +n1 characters have been received is  difficult, expensive, or impossible to implement in some system environments. Consequently, a number of  existing implementations do not comply with this requirement. Since line-editing and collection functions  are often implemented by system components beyond the control of the Forth implementation, this Standard  imposes no such requirement. A Standard Program may only assume that it can receive an input string with  `ACCEPT` or `EXPECT`. The detailed sequence of user actions necessary to prepare and transmit that line are  beyond the scope of this Standard.

Specification of a non-zero, positive integer count (+n1) for ACCEPT allows some implementors to  continue their practice of using a zero or negative value as a flag to trigger special behavior. Insofar as such  behavior is outside the Standard, Standard Programs cannot depend upon it, but the Technical Committee  doesn't wish to preclude it unnecessarily. Since actual values are almost always small integers, no  functionality is impaired by this restriction.

`ACCEPT` and `EXPECT` perform similar functions. `ACCEPT` is recommended for new programs, and future  use of `EXPECT` is discouraged.

It is recommended that all non-graphic characters be reserved for editing or control functions and not be  stored in the input string.

Commonly, when the user is preparing an input string to be transmitted to a program, the system allows the  user to edit that string and correct mistakes before transmitting the final version of the string. The editing  function is supplied sometimes by the Forth system itself, and sometimes by external system software or  hardware. Thus, control characters and functions may not be available on all systems. In the usual case, the  end of the editing process and final transmission of the string is signified by the user pressing a "Return" or  "Enter" key.

As in previous standards, `EXPECT` returns the input string immediately after the requested number of  characters are entered, as well as when a line terminator is received. The "automatic termination after  specified count of characters have been entered" behavior is widely considered undesirable because the user "loses control" of the input editing process at a potentially unknown time (the user does not necessarily know how many characters were requested from `EXPECT`). Thus `EXPECT` and `SPAN` have been made  obsolescent and exist in the Standard only as a concession to existing implementations. If `EXPECT` exists in  a Standard System it must have the "automatic termination" behavior.

`ACCEPT` does not have the "automatic termination" behavior of `EXPECT`. However, because external  system hardware and software may perform the `ACCEPT` function, when a line terminator is received the  action of the cursor, and therefore the display, is implementation-defined. It is recommended that the cursor  remain immediately following the entered text after a line terminator is received.

#### A.6.1.0705 ALIGN 

In this Standard we have attempted to provide transportability across various CPU architectures. One of the  frequent causes of transportability problems is the requirement of cell-aligned addresses on some CPUs. On  these systems, `ALIGN` and `ALIGNED` may be required to build and traverse data structures built with `C,`.  Implementors may define these words as no-ops on systems for which they aren't functional.

#### A.6.1.0706 `ALIGNED` 

See: **A.6.1.0705 `ALIGN`**.

#### A.6.1.0760 `BEGIN` 

Typical use:

    : X ... BEGIN ... test UNTIL ; 

or

    : X ... BEGIN ... test WHILE ... REPEAT ;

#### A.6.1.0770 `BL` 

Because space is used throughout Forth as the standard delimiter, this word is the only way a program has to  find and use the system value of "space". The value of a space character can not be obtained with `CHAR`,  for instance.

#### A.6.1.0880 `CELL+` 

As with `ALIGN` and `ALIGNED`, the words `CELL` and `CELL+` were added to aid in transportability across  systems with different cell sizes. They are intended to be used in manipulating indexes and addresses in  integral numbers of cell-widths.

Example:

    2VARIABLE DATA 
    0 100 DATA 2! 
    DATA @ . 100  
    DATA CELL+ @ . 0  

#### A.6.1.0890 CELLS 

See: **A.6.1.0880 CELL+**.

Example: `CREATE NUMBERS 100 CELLS ALLOT` 

(Allots space in the array `NUMBERS` for 100 cells of data.) 

#### A.6.1.0895 CHAR 

Typical use: ... `CHAR A CONSTANT "A"` ...

#### A.6.1.0950 CONSTANT 

Typical use: ... `DECIMAL 10 CONSTANT TEN` ...

#### A.6.1.1000 `CREATE` 

The data-field address of a word defined by `CREATE` is given by the data-space pointer immediately  following the execution of `CREATE` Reservation of data field space is typically done with `ALLOT`.

Typical use: ... `CREATE SOMETHING` ...

#### A.6.1.1240 `DO` 

Typical use:  

    : X ... limit first DO ... LOOP ; 

or  

    : X ... limit first DO ... step +LOOP ; 

#### A.6.1.1250 `DOES>` 

Typical use: `: X ... DOES> ... ;` 

Following `DOES>`, a Standard Program may not make any assumptions regarding the ability to find either  the name of the definition containing the `DOES>` or any previous definition whose name may be concealed  by it. `DOES>` effectively ends one definition and begins another as far as local variables and control-flow  structures are concerned. The compilation behavior makes it clear that the user is not entitled to place  `DOES>` inside any control-flow structures.

#### A.6.1.1310 `ELSE` 

Typical use: : `X ... test IF ... ELSE ... THEN ;` 

#### A.6.1.1345 `ENVIRONMENT?` 

In a Standard System that contains only the Core word set, effective use of ENVIRONMENT? requires either  its use within a definition, or the use of user-supplied auxiliary definitions. The Core word set lacks both a  direct method for collecting a string in interpretation state (**11.6.1.2165  `S"`** is in an optional word set) and  also a means to test the returned flag in interpretation state (e.g. the optional 15.6.2.2532 `[IF]`).

The combination of **6.1.1345 ENVIRONMENT?**, **11.6.1.2165 `S"`**, **15.6.2.2532 `[IF]`**, **15.6.2.2531 `[ELSE]`**,  and **15.6.2.2533 `[THEN]`** constitutes an effective suite of words for conditional compilation that works in  interpretation state.

#### A.6.1.1360 `EVALUATE` 

The Technical Committee is aware that this function is commonly spelled EVAL. However, there exist  implementations that could suffer by defining the word as is done here. We also find EVALUATE to be  more readable and explicit. There was some sentiment for calling this INTERPRET, but that too would  have undesirable effects on existing code. The longer spelling was not deemed significant since this is not a  word that should be used frequently in source code.

#### A.6.1.1380 EX`IT 

Typical use: `: X ... test IF ... EXIT THEN ... ;` 

#### A.6.1.1550 `FIND` 

 
One of the more difficult issues which the Committee took on was the problem of divorcing the  specification of implementation mechanisms from the specification of the Forth language. Three basic  implementation approaches can be quickly enumerated:

1) Threaded code mechanisms. These are the traditional approaches to implementing Forth, but other techniques may be used.
2) Subroutine threading with "macro-expansion" (code copying). Short routines, like the code for DUP, are copied into a definition rather than compiling a JSR reference.
3) Native coding with optimization. This may include stack optimization (replacing such phrases as SWAP ROT + with one or two machine instructions, for example), parallelization (the trend in the  newer RISC chips is to have several functional subunits which can execute in parallel), and so on.

The initial requirement (inherited from Forth 83) that compilation addresses be compiled into the dictionary  disallowed type 2 and type 3 implementations.

Type 3 mechanisms and optimizations of type 2 implementations were hampered by the explicit  specification of immediacy or non-immediacy of all standard words. POSTPONE allowed de-specification  of immediacy or non-immediacy for all but a few Forth words whose behavior must be STATE-independent.

One type 3 implementation, Charles Moore's cmForth, has both compiling and interpreting versions of  many Forth words. At the present, this appears to be a common approach for type 3 implementations. The  Committee felt that this implementation approach must be allowed. Consequently, it is possible that words  without interpretation semantics can be found only during compilation, and other words may exist in two  versions: a compiling version and an interpreting version. Hence the values returned by FIND may depend  on `STATE`, and ` and `[']` may be unable to find words without interpretation semantics.

#### A.6.1.1561 `FM/MOD` 

By introducing the requirement for "floored" division, Forth 83 produced much controversy and concern on  the part of those who preferred the more common practice followed in other languages of implementing  division according to the behavior of the host CPU, which is most often symmetric (rounded toward zero).  In attempting to find a compromise position, this Standard provides primitives for both common varieties,  floored and symmetric (see `SM/REM`). `FM/MOD` is the floored version.

The Technical Committee considered providing two complete sets of explicitly named division operators,  and declined to do so on the grounds that this would unduly enlarge and complicate the Standard. Instead,  implementors may define the normal division words in terms of either `FM/MOD` or `SM/REM` providing they  document their choice. People wishing to have explicitly named sets of operators are encouraged to do so.  `FM/MOD` may be used, for example, to define:

    : /_MOD ( n1 n2 -- n3 n4) >R S>D R> FM/MOD ; 
    : /_ ( n1 n2 -- n3) /_MOD SWAP DROP ; 
    : _MOD ( n1 n2 -- n3) /_MOD DROP ; 
    : */_MOD ( n1 n2 n3 -- n4 n5) >R M* R> FM/MOD ; 
    : */_ ( n1 n2 n3 -- n4 ) */_MOD SWAP DROP ; 

#### A.6.1.1700 IF 

Typical use:

    : X ... test IF ... THEN ... ; 

or

    : X ... test IF ... ELSE ... THEN ... ; 

#### A.6.1.1710 IMMEDIATE 

Typical use: `Typical use: : X ... ; IMMEDIATE `

#### A.6.1.1720 INVERT 

The word NOT was originally provided in Forth as a flag operator to make control structures readable.  Under its intended usage the following two definitions would produce identical results:

    : ONE ( flag -- ) 
        IF ." true" ELSE ." false" THEN ; 
    : TWO ( flag -- ) 
        NOT IF ." false" ELSE ." true" THEN ; 

This was common usage prior to the Forth-83 Standard which redefined NOT as a cell-wide one's-complement operation, functionally equivalent to the phrase -1 XOR. At the same time, the data type  manipulated by this word was changed from a flag to a cell-wide collection of bits and the standard value  for true was changed from "1" (rightmost bit only set) to "-1" (all bits set). As these definitions of TRUE and NOT were incompatible with their previous definitions, many Forth users continue to rely on the old  definitions. Hence both versions are in common use.

Therefore, usage of NOT cannot be standardized at this time. The two traditional meanings of NOT - that of  negating the sense of a flag and that of doing a one's complement operation - are made available by 0= and  INVERT, respectively.

#### A.6.1.1730 J 

J may only be used with a nested DO...LOOP, DO...+LOOP, ?DO...LOOP, or ?DO...+LOOP, for example, in  the form:  

    : X ... DO ... DO ... J ... LOOP ... +LOOP ... ; 

#### A.6.1.1760 LEAVE 

Note that LEAVE immediately exits the loop. No words following LEAVE within the loop will be executed.

Typical use:

    : X ... DO ... IF ... LEAVE THEN ... LOOP ... ; 

#### A.6.1.1780 LITERAL 

Typical use: : X ... [ x ] LITERAL ... ; 

#### A.6.1.1800 LOOP 

Typical use:

    : X ... limit first DO ... LOOP ... ; 

or

    : X ... limit first ?DO ... LOOP ... ; 

#### A.6.1.1810 M* 

This word is a useful early step in calculation, going to extra precision conveniently. It has been in use  since the Forth systems of the early 1970's.

#### A.6.1.1900 MOVE 

CMOVE and CMOVE> are the primary move operators in Forth 83. They specify a behavior for moving that  implies propagation if the move is suitably invoked. In some hardware, this specific behavior cannot be  achieved using the best move instruction. Further, CMOVE and CMOVE> move characters; ANS Forth needs  a move instruction capable of dealing with address units. Thus MOVE has been defined and added to the  Core word set, and CMOVE and CMOVE> have been moved to the String word set.

#### A.6.1.2033 POSTPONE 

Typical use:  

    : ENDIF POSTPONE THEN ; IMMEDIATE 
    : X ... IF ... ENDIF ... ; 


POSTPONE replaces most of the functionality of COMPILE and [COMPILE]. COMPILE and [COMPILE] are used for the same purpose: postpone the compilation behavior of the next word in the parse area. COMPILE was designed to be applied to non-immediate words and [COMPILE] to immediate  words. This burdens the programmer with needing to know which words in a system are immediate.

Consequently, Forth standards have had to specify the immediacy or non-immediacy of all words covered  by the Standard. This unnecessarily constrains implementors.

A second problem with COMPILE is that some programmers have come to expect and exploit a particular  implementation, namely:  

    : COMPILE R> DUP @ , CELL+ >R ; 

This implementation will not work on native code Forth systems. In a native code Forth using inline code  expansion and peephole optimization, the size of the object code produced varies; this information is  difficult to communicate to a "dumb" COMPILE. A "smart" (i.e., immediate) COMPILE would not have  this problem, but this was forbidden in previous standards.

For these reasons, COMPILE has not been included in the Standard and [COMPILE] has been moved in  favor of POSTPONE. Additional discussion can be found in Hayes, J.R., "Postpone", *Proceedings of the 1989 Rochester Forth Conference.*

#### A.6.1.2120 RECURSE 

Typical use: : X ... RECURSE ... ; 

This is Forth's recursion operator; in some implementations it is called MYSELF. The usual example is the  coding of the factorial function.

    : FACTORIAL ( +n1 -- +n2) 
        DUP 2 < IF DROP 1 EXIT THEN 
        DUP 1- RECURSE * 
    ;
 
*n2 = n1(n1-1)(n1-2)...*(2)(1), the product of n1 with all positive integers less than itself (as a special case,  zero factorial equals one). While beloved of computer scientists, recursion makes unusually heavy use of  both stacks and should therefore be used with caution. See alternate definition in A.6.1.2140 REPEAT.

#### A.6.1.2140 REPEAT 

Typical use:  

    : FACTORIAL ( +n1 -- +n2) 
        DUP 2 < IF DROP 1 EXIT THEN 
        DUP 
        BEGIN DUP 2 > WHILE 
            1- SWAP OVER * SWAP 
        REPEAT DROP 
    ; 

#### A.6.1.2165 S" 

Typical use: : X ... S" ccc" ... ; 

This word is found in many systems under the name " (quote). However, current practice is almost evenly  divided on the use of ", with many systems using the execution semantics given here, while others return the  address of a counted string. We attempt here to satisfy both camps by providing two words, S" and the  Core Extension word C" so that users may have whichever behavior they expect with a simple renaming  operation.

#### A.6.1.2214 SM/REM 

See the previous discussion of division under FM/MOD. SM/REM is the symmetric-division primitive,  which allows programs to define the following symmetric-division operators:  

    : /-REM ( n1 n2 -- n3 n4 ) >R S>D R> SM/REM ; 
    : /- ( n1 n2 -- n3 ) /-REM SWAP DROP ; 
    : -REM ( n1 n2 -- n3 ) /-REM DROP ; 
    : */-REM ( n1 n2 n3 -- n4 n5 ) >R M* R> SM/REM ; 
    : */- ( n1 n2 n3 -- n4 ) */-REM SWAP DROP ; 

#### A.6.1.2216 SOURCE 

SOURCE simplifies the process of directly accessing the input buffer by hiding the differences between its  location for different input sources. This also gives implementors more flexibility in their implementation  of buffering mechanisms for different input sources. The committee moved away from an input buffer  specification consisting of a collection of individual variables, declaring TIB and #TIB obsolescent.

SOURCE in this form exists in F83, POLYFORTH, LMI's Forths and others. In conventional systems it is  equivalent to the phrase  

    BLK @ IF BLK @ BLOCK 1024 ELSE TIB #TIB @ THEN  

#### A.6.1.2250 STATE 

Although EVALUATE, LOAD, INCLUDE-FILE, and INCLUDED are not listed as words which alter  STATE, the text interpreted by any one of these words could include one or more words which explicitly  alter STATE. EVALUATE, LOAD, INCLUDE-FILE, and INCLUDED do not in themselves alter STATE.

STATE does not nest with text interpreter nesting. For example, the code sequence:  

    : FOO S" ]" EVALUATE ; FOO 

will leave the system in compilation state. Similarly, after LOADing a block containing ], the system will be  in compilation state.

Note that ] does not affect the parse area and that the only effect that : has on the parse area is to parse a  word. This entitles a program to use these words to set the state with known side-effects on the parse area.

For example:  

    : NOP : POSTPONE ; IMMEDIATE ; 
    NOP ALIGN NOP ALIGNED  
    
Some non-ANS Forth compliant systems have ] invoke a compiler loop in addition to setting STATE. Such  a system would inappropriately attempt to compile the second use of NOP.

Also note that nothing in the Standard prevents a program from finding the execution tokens of ] or [ and  using these to affect STATE. These facts suggest that implementations of ] will do nothing but set STATE and a single interpreter/compiler loop will monitor STATE.

#### A.6.1.2270 THEN 

Typical use:  

    : X ... test IF ... THEN ... ; 

or  

    : X ... test IF ... ELSE ... THEN ... ; 

#### A.6.1.2380 UNLOOP 

Typical use:  

    : X ...
        limit first DO 
          ... test IF ... UNLOOP EXIT THEN ...
        LOOP ...
    ;
 
UNLOOP allows the use of EXIT within the context of DO ... LOOP and related do-loop constructs.  UNLOOP as a function has been called UNDO. UNLOOP is more indicative of the action: nothing gets  undone -- we simply stop doing it.

#### A.6.1.2390 UNTIL 

Typical use: : X ... BEGIN ... test UNTIL ... ; 

#### A.6.1.2410 VARIABLE 

Typical use: ... VARIABLE XYZ ...

#### A.6.1.2430 WHILE 

Typical use: : X ... BEGIN ... test WHILE ... REPEAT ... ; 

#### A.6.1.2450 WORD 

Typical use: *char* `WORD` *ccc&lt;char>* 

#### A.6.1.2500 [ 

Typical use: : X ... [ 4321 ] LITERAL ... ; 

#### A.6.1.2510 ['] 

Typical use: : X ... ['] name ... ; 

See: **A.6.1.1550 FIND**.

#### A.6.1.2520 [CHAR] 

Typical use: : X ... [CHAR] ccc ... ; 

#### A.6.1.2540 ] 

Typical use: : X ... [ 1234 ] LITERAL ... ; 

### A.6.2 Core extension words 

The words in this collection fall into several categories:  

- Words that are in common use but are deemed less essential than Core words (e.g., 0&lt;>); 
- Words that are in common use but can be trivially defined from Core words (e.g., FALSE); 
- Words that are primarily useful in narrowly defined types of applications or are in less frequent use (e.g., PARSE); 
- Words that are being deprecated in favor of new words introduced to solve specific problems (e.g., CONVERT).

Because of the varied justifications for inclusion of these words, the Technical Committee does not  encourage implementors to offer the complete collection, but to select those words deemed most valuable to  their clientele.

#### A.6.2.0060 #TIB 

The function of #TIB has been superseded by SOURCE.

#### A.6.2.0200 .( 

Typical use: .( ccc) 

#### A.6.2.0210 .R 

In .R, "R" is short for RIGHT.

#### A.6.2.0340 2>R 

Historically, 2>R has been used to implement DO. Hence the order of parameters on the return stack.

The primary advantage of 2>R is that it puts the top stack entry on the top of the return stack. For instance,  a double-cell number may be transferred to the return stack and still have the most significant cell accessible  on the top of the return stack.

#### A.6.2.0410 2R> 

Note that 2R> is not equivalent to R> R>. Instead, it mirrors the action of 2>R (see A.6.2.0340).

#### A.6.2.0455 :NONAME 

:NONAME allows a user to create an execution token with the semantics of a colon definition without an associated name. Previously, only : (colon) could create an execution token with these semantics. Thus,  Forth code could only be compiled using the syntax of :, that is:

    : NAME ... ; 

:NONAME removes this constraint and places the Forth compiler in the hands of the programmer.

:NONAME can be used to create application-specific programming languages. One technique is to mix Forth code fragments with application-specific constructs. The application-specific constructs use  :NONAME to compile the Forth code and store the corresponding execution tokens in data structures.

The functionality of :NONAME can be built on any Forth system. For years, expert Forth programmers have  exploited intimate knowledge of their systems to generate unnamed code fragments. Now, this function has  been named and can be used in a portable program.

For example, :NONAME can be used to build a table of code fragments where indexing into the table allows  executing a particular fragment. The declaration syntax of the table is:  

    :NONAME .. code for command 0 .. ; 0 CMD ! 
    :NONAME .. code for command 1 .. ; 1 CMD ! 
        ...
    :NONAME .. code for command 99 .. ; 99 CMD ! 

    ... 5 CMD @ EXECUTE ...

The definitions of the table building words are:  

    CREATE CMD-TABLE \ table for command execution tokens  
       100 CELLS ALLOT 

    : CMD ( n -- a-addr ) \ nth element address in table 
       CELLS CMD-TABLE + ; 

As a further example, a defining word can be created to allow performance monitoring. In the example  below, the number of times a word is executed is counted. : must first be renamed to allow the definition of  the new ;.

    : DOCOLON ( -- ) 
    \ Modify CREATEd word to execute like a colon def 
      DOES> ( i*x a-addr -- j*x ) 
       1 OVER +! \ count executions 
       CELL+ @ EXECUTE \ execute :NONAME definition 
    ;
    : OLD: : ; \ just an alias 
    OLD: : ( "name" -- a-addr xt colon-sys )
    \ begins an execution-counting colon definition 
        CREATE HERE 0 ,     \ storage for execution counter 
        0 ,                 \ storage for execution token 
        DOCOLON             \ set run time for CREATEd word 
        :NONAME             \ begin unnamed colon definition 
    ;

(Note the placement of DOES>: DOES> must modify the CREATEd word and not the :NONAME definition, so DOES> must execute before :NONAME.)  

    OLD: ; ( a-addr xt colon-sys -- )  
    \ ends an execution-counting colon definition ) 
        POSTPONE ; \ complete compilation of colon def 
        SWAP CELL+ ! \ save execution token 
    ; IMMEDIATE 

The new : and ; are used just like the standard ones to define words:  

    ... : xxx ... ; ... xxx ...

Now however, these words may be "ticked" to retrieve the count (and execution token):  

    ... ' xxx >BODY ? ...

#### A.6.2.0620 ?DO 

Typical use: 

    : FACTORIAL ( +n1 -- +n2 ) 1 SWAP 1+ ?DO I * LOOP ; 

This word was added in response to many requests for a resolution of the difficulty introduced by Forth-83's  DO, which on a 16-bit system will loop 65,535 times if given equal arguments. As this Standard also  encourages 32-bit systems, this behavior can be intolerable. The Technical Committee considered applying  these semantics to DO, but declined on the grounds that it might break existing code.

#### A.6.2.0700 AGAIN 

Typical use: : X ... BEGIN ... AGAIN ... ; 

Unless word-sequence has a way to terminate, this is an endless loop.

#### A.6.2.0855 C" 

Typical use: : X ... C" ccc" ... ; 

It is easy to convert counted strings to pointer/length but hard to do the opposite. C" is the only new word  that uses the "address of counted string" stack representation. It is provided as an aid to porting existing  programs to ANS Forth systems. It is relatively difficult to implement C" in terms of other standard words,  considering its "compile string into the current definition" semantics.

Users of C" are encouraged to migrate their application code toward the consistent use of the preferred "c-addr u" stack representation with the alternate word S". This may be accomplished by converting application words with counted string input arguments to use the preferred "c-addr u" representation, thus  eliminating the need for C" .

See: **A.3.1.3.4 Counted strings**.

#### A.6.2.0873 CASE 

Typical use:  

    : X ...
        CASE 
            test1 OF ... ENDOF 
            testn OF ... ENDOF 
            ... ( default ) 
        ENDCASE ...
    ; 

#### A.6.2.0945 COMPILE, 

COMPILE, is the compilation equivalent of EXECUTE. In many cases, it is possible to compile a word by  using POSTPONE without resorting to the use of COMPILE,. However, the use of POSTPONE requires  that the name of the word must be known at compile time, whereas COMPILE, allows the word to be  located at any time. It is sometime possible to use EVALUATE to compile a word whose name is not known  until run time. This has two possible problems:  

- EVALUATE is slower than COMPILE, because a dictionary search is required.
- The current search order affects the outcome of EVALUATE.

In traditional threaded-code implementations, compilation is performed by , (comma). This usage is not  portable; it doesn't work for subroutine-threaded, native code, or relocatable implementations. Use of  COMPILE, is portable.


In most systems it is possible to implement COMPILE, so it will generate code that is optimized to the  same extent as code that is generated by the normal compilation process. However, in some  implementations there are two different "tokens" corresponding to a particular definition name: the normal "execution token" that is used while interpreting or with EXECUTE, and another "compilation token" that is used while compiling. It is not always possible to obtain the compilation token from the execution token.  In these implementations, COMPILE, might not generate code that is as efficient as normally compiled  code.

#### A.6.2.0970 CONVERT 

CONVERT may be defined as follows:  

    : CONVERT CHAR+ 65535 >NUMBER DROP ; 

#### A.6.2.1342 ENDCASE 

Typical use:  

    : X ...
        CASE 
            test1 OF ... ENDOF 
            testn OF ... ENDOF 
            ... ( default ) 
        ENDCASE ...
    ; 

#### A.6.2.1343 ENDOF 

Typical use:  

    : X ...
        CASE 
            test1 OF ... ENDOF 
            testn OF ... ENDOF 
            ... ( default ) 
        ENDCASE ...
    ; 

#### A.6.2.1390 EXPECT 

Specification of positive integer counts (+n) for EXPECT allows some implementors to continue their  practice of using a zero or negative value as a flag to trigger special behavior. Insofar as such behavior is  outside the Standard, Standard Programs cannot depend upon it, but the Technical Committee doesn't wish  to preclude it unnecessarily. Since actual values are almost always small integers, no functionality is  impaired by this restriction.

#### A.6.2.1850 MARKER 

As dictionary implementations have gotten more elaborate and in some cases have used multiple address  spaces, FORGET has become prohibitively difficult or impossible to implement on many Forth systems.  MARKER greatly eases the problem by making it possible for the system to remember "landmark  information" in advance that specifically marks the spots where the dictionary may at some future time have  to be rearranged.

#### A.6.2.1950 OF 

Typical use:  

    : X ...
        CASE 
            test1 OF ... ENDOF 
            testn OF ... ENDOF 
            ... ( default ) 
        ENDCASE ...
    ; 

#### A.6.2.2000 PAD 

PAD has been available as scratch storage for strings since the earliest Forth implementations. It was  brought to our attention that many programmers are reluctant to use PAD, fearing incompatibilities with  system uses. PAD is specifically intended as a programmer convenience, however, which is why we  documented the fact that no standard words use it.

#### A.6.2.2008 PARSE 

Typical use: char PARSE ccc&lt;char> 

The traditional Forth word for parsing is WORD. PARSE solves the following problems with WORD:  

a) WORD always skips leading delimiters. This behavior is appropriate for use by the text interpreter,  which looks for sequences of non-blank characters, but is inappropriate for use by words like ( , .( ,  and ." . Consider the following (flawed) definition of .( :  

    : .( [CHAR] ) WORD COUNT TYPE ; IMMEDIATE 

This works fine when used in a line like:  

    .( HELLO) 5 .

but consider what happens if the user enters an empty string:  

    .( ) 5 .

The definition of .( shown above would treat the ) as a leading delimiter, skip it, and continue  consuming characters until it located another ) that followed a non-) character, or until the parse area  was empty. In the example shown, the 5 . would be treated as part of the string to be printed.

With PARSE, we could write a correct definition of .( :  
 
    : .( [CHAR] ) PARSE TYPE ; IMMEDIATE 

This definition avoids the "empty string" anomaly.

b) WORD returns its result as a counted string. This has four bad effects:  

1) The characters accepted by WORD must be copied from the input buffer into a temporary buffer, in order to make room for the count character that must be at the beginning of the counted string. The  copy step is inefficient, compared to PARSE, which leaves the string in the input buffer and doesn't  need to copy it anywhere.

2) WORD must be careful not to store too many characters into the temporary buffer, thus overwriting something beyond the end of the buffer. This adds to the overhead of the copy step. (WORD may have  to scan a lot of characters before finding the trailing delimiter.)

3) The count character limits the length of the string returned by WORD to 255 characters (longer strings can easily be stored in blocks!). This limitation does not exist for PARSE.

4) The temporary buffer is typically overwritten by the next use of WORD. This introduces a temporal dependency; the value returned by WORD is only valid for a limited duration. PARSE has a temporal  dependency, too, related to the lifetime of the input buffer, but that is less severe in most cases than  WORD's temporal dependency.

The behavior of WORD with respect to skipping leading delimiters is useful for parsing blank-delimited  names. Many system implementations include an additional word for this purpose, similar to PARSE with  respect to the "c-addr u" return value, but without an explicit delimiter argument (the delimiter set is  implicitly "white space"), and which does skip leading delimiters. A common description for this word is:  

    PARSE-WORD ( "<spaces>name" -- c-addr u )  

    Skip leading spaces and parse name delimited by a space. c-addr is the address within the input buffer  and u is the length of the selected string. If the parse area is empty, the resulting string has a zero  length.

If both PARSE and PARSE-WORD are present, the need for WORD is largely eliminated.

#### A.6.2.2030 PICK 

0 PICK is equivalent to DUP and 1 PICK is equivalent to OVER.

#### A.6.2.2040 QUERY 

The function of QUERY may be performed with ACCEPT and EVALUATE.

#### A.6.2.2125 REFILL 

This word is a useful generalization of QUERY. Re-defining QUERY to meet this specification would have  broken existing code. REFILL is designed to behave reasonably for all possible input sources. If the input  source is coming from the user, as with QUERY, REFILL could still return a false value if, for instance, a  communication channel closes so that the system knows that no more input will be available.

#### A.6.2.2150 ROLL 

2 ROLL is equivalent to ROT, 1 ROLL is equivalent to SWAP and 0 ROLL is a null operation.

#### A.6.2.2182 SAVE-INPUT 

SAVE-INPUT and RESTORE-INPUT allow the same degree of input source repositioning within a text  file as is available with BLOCK input. SAVE-INPUT and RESTORE-INPUT "hide the details" of the  operations necessary to accomplish this repositioning, and are used the same way with all input sources.  This makes it easier for programs to reposition the input source, because they do not have to inspect several  variables and take different action depending on the values of those variables.

SAVE-INPUT and RESTORE-INPUT are intended for repositioning within a single input source; for  example, the following scenario is NOT allowed for a Standard Program:  

    : XX 
        SAVE-INPUT CREATE 
        S" RESTORE-INPUT" EVALUATE 
        ABORT" couldn't restore input" 
    ;
 
This is incorrect because, at the time RESTORE-INPUT is executed, the input source is the string via  EVALUATE, which is not the same input source that was in effect when SAVE-INPUT was executed.

The following code is allowed:  

    : XX 
        SAVE-INPUT CREATE 
        S" .( Hello)" EVALUATE 
        RESTORE-INPUT ABORT" couldn't restore input" 
    ;
 
After EVALUATE returns, the input source specification is restored to its previous state, thus SAVE-INPUT and RESTORE-INPUT are called with the same input source in effect.

In the above examples, the EVALUATE phrase could have been replaced by a phrase involving INCLUDE-FILE and the same rules would apply.

The Standard does not specify what happens if a program violates the above rules. A Standard System  might check for the violation and return an exception indication from RESTORE-INPUT, or it might fail in  an unpredictable way.

The return value from RESTORE-INPUT is primarily intended to report the case where the program  attempts to restore the position of an input source whose position cannot be restored. The keyboard might  be such an input source.

Nesting of SAVE-INPUT and RESTORE-INPUT is allowed. For example, the following situation works  as expected:   

    : XX 
        SAVE-INPUT 
            S" f1" INCLUDED 
            \ The file "f1" includes: 
            \ ... SAVE-INPUT ... RESTORE-INPUT ...
            \ End of file "f1" 
        RESTORE-INPUT ABORT" couldn't restore input" 
    ;
 
In principle, RESTORE-INPUT could be implemented to "always fail", e.g.:  

    : RESTORE-INPUT ( x1 ... xn n -- flag ) 
        0 ?DO DROP LOOP TRUE 
    ;
 
Such an implementation would not be useful in most cases. It would be preferable for a system to leave  SAVE-INPUT and RESTORE-INPUT undefined, rather than to create a useless implementation. In the  absence of the words, the application programmer could choose whether or not to create "dummy"  implementations or to work-around the problem in some other way.

Examples of how an implementation might use the return values from SAVE-INPUT to accomplish the  save/restore function:  

 |Input Source|possible stack values  
 |--|--|
 |block|>IN @ BLK @ 2 
 |EVALUATE|>IN @ 1 
 |keyboard|>IN @ 1 
 |text file|>IN @ lo-pos hi-pos 3

These are examples only; a Standard Program may not assume any particular meaning for the individual  stack items returned by SAVE-INPUT.

#### A.6.2.2290 TIB 

The function of TIB has been superseded by SOURCE.

#### A.6.2.2295 TO 

Historically, some implementations of TO have not explicitly parsed. Instead, they set a mode flag that is  tested by the subsequent execution of name. ANS Forth explicitly requires that TO must parse, so that TO's  effect will be predictable when it is used at the end of the parse area.

Typical use: x TO name 

#### A.6.2.2298 TRUE 

TRUE is equivalent to the phrase 0 0=.

#### A.6.2.2405 VALUE 

Typical use:  

    0 VALUE DATA 
    : EXCHANGE ( n1 -- n2 ) DATA SWAP TO DATA ; 

EXCHANGE leaves n1 in DATA and returns the prior value n2.

#### A.6.2.2440 WITHIN 

We describe WITHIN without mentioning circular number spaces (an undefined term) or providing the  code. Here is a number line with the overflow point (o) at the far right and the underflow point (u) at the far  left:  

u--------------------------------------------------------------o  

There are two cases to consider: either the n2|u2..n3|u3 range straddles the overflow/underflow points or it  does not. Lets examine the non-straddle case first:  

u-------------------[.....................)------------------------o  

The [ denotes n2|u2, the ) denotes n3|u3, and the dots and [ are numbers WITHIN the range. n3|u3 is greater  than n2|u2, so the following tests will determine if n1|u1 is WITHIN n2|u2 and n3|u3:  

    n2|u2 ≤ n1|u1 and n1|u1 < n3|u3.

In the case where the comparison range straddles the overflow/underflow points:

u...............)-----------------------------[........................o  

n3|u3 is less than n2|u2 and the following tests will determine if n1|u1 is WITHIN n2|u2 and n3|u3:  

    n2|u2 ≤ n1|u1 or n1|u1 < n3|u3.

WITHIN must work for both signed and unsigned arguments. One obvious implementation does not work:  

    : WITHIN ( test low high -- flag ) 
        >R OVER < 0= ( test flag1 ) SWAP R> < ( flag1 flag2 ) AND 
    ; 

Assume two's-complement arithmetic on a 16-bit machine, and consider the following test:  

    33000 32000 34000 WITHIN 

The above implementation returns false for that test, even though the unsigned number 33000 is clearly  within the range {{32000 .. 34000}}.

The problem is that, in the incorrect implementation, the signed comparison &lt; gives the wrong answer when 32000 is compared to 33000, because when those numbers are treated as signed numbers, 33000 is treated as negative 32536, while 32000 remains positive.

    1 -5 5 WITHIN 

Replacing &lt; with `U<` in the above implementation makes it work with unsigned numbers, but causes  problems with certain signed number ranges; in particular, the test:  would give an incorrect answer.

For two’s-complement machines that ignore arithmetic overflow (most machines), the following  implementation works in all cases:  

    : WITHIN ( test low high -- flag ) OVER - >R - R> U< ; 

#### A.6.2.2530 [COMPILE] 

Typical use  : name2 ... [COMPILE] name1 ... ; IMMEDIATE

#### A.6.2.2535 \ 

Typical use:  5 CONSTANT THAT  \  THIS IS A COMMENT ABOUT THAT

## A.7 The optional Block word set 

Early Forth systems ran stand-alone, with no host OS. Blocks of 1024 bytes were designed as a convenient  unit of disk, and most native Forth systems still use them. It is relatively easy to write a native disk driver  that maps head/track/sector addresses to block numbers. Such disk drivers are extremely fast in comparison  with conventional file-oriented operating systems, and security is high because there is no reliance on a disk  map.

Today many Forth implementations run under host operating systems, because the compatibility they offer  the user outweighs the performance overhead. Many people who use such systems prefer using host OS  files only; however, people who use both native and non-native Forths need a compatible way of accessing  disk. The Block Word set includes the most common words for accessing program source and data on disk.

In order to guarantee that Standard Programs that need access to mass storage have a mechanism  appropriate for both native and non-native implementations, ANS Forth requires that the Block word set be  available if any mass storage facilities are provided. On non-native implementations, blocks normally  reside in host OS files.

### A.7.2 Additional terms 

<miniterm>

||block||
Many Forth systems use blocks to contain program source. Conventionally such blocks are formatted for  editing as 16 lines of 64 characters. Source blocks are often referred to as "screens".

</miniterm>

### A.7.6 Glossary 

##### A.7.6.2.2190 SCR 

SCR is short for screen.

## A.8 The optional Double-Number word set 

Forth systems on 8-bit and 16-bit processors often find it necessary to deal with double-length numbers.  But many Forths on small embedded systems do not, and many users of Forth on systems with a cell size of  32-bits or more find that the necessity for double-length numbers is much diminished. Therefore, we have factored the words that manipulate double-length entities into this optional word set.

Please note that the naming convention used in this word set conveys some important information:  

1. Words whose names are of the form 2xxx deal with cell pairs, where the relationship between the cells is unspecified. They may be two-vectors, double-length numbers, or any pair of cells that it is  convenient to manipulate together.
2. Words with names of the form Dxxx deal specifically with double-length integers.
3. Words with names of the form Mxxx deal with some combination of single and double integers. The order in which these appear on the stack is determined by long-standing common practice.

Refer to A.3.1 for a discussion of data types in Forth.

### A.8.6 Glossary 

##### A.8.6.1.0360 2CONSTANT 

Typical use: x1 x2 2CONSTANT name 

##### A.8.6.1.0390 2LITERAL 

Typical use: : X ... [ x1 x2 ] 2LITERAL ... ; 

##### A.8.6.1.0440 2VARIABLE 

Typical use: 2VARIABLE name 

##### A.8.6.1.1070 D.R 

In D.R, the "R" is short for RIGHT.

##### A.8.6.1.1090 D2* 

See: **A.6.1.0320 2* for applicable discussion**.

##### A.8.6.1.1100 D2/ 

See: **A.6.1.0330 2/ for applicable discussion**.

##### A.8.6.1.1140 D>S 

There exist number representations, e.g., the sign-magnitude representation, where reduction from double to single-precision cannot simply be done with `DROP`. This word, equivalent to `DROP` on two’s complement  systems, desensitizes application code to number representation and facilitates portability.

##### A.8.6.1.1820 M*/ 

`M*/` was once described by Chuck Moore as the most useful arithmetic operator in Forth. It is the main  workhorse in most computations involving double-cell numbers. Note that some systems allow signed  divisors. This can cost a lot in performance on some CPUs. The requirement for a positive divisor has not  proven to be a problem.

##### A.8.6.1.1830 M+ 

M+ is the classical method for integrating.

## A.9 The optional Exception word set 

`CATCH` and `THROW` provide a reliable mechanism for handling exceptions, without having to propagate  exception flags through multiple levels of word nesting. It is similar in spirit to the "non-local return"  mechanisms of many other languages, such as C’s setjmp() and longjmp(), and LISP’s `CATCH` and  `THROW`. In the Forth context, `THROW` may be described as a "multi-level `EXIT`", with `CATCH` marking a  location to which a `THROW` may return.

Several similar Forth "multi-level `EXIT`" exception-handling schemes have been described and used in past  years. It is not possible to implement such a scheme using only standard words (other than `CATCH` and  `THROW`), because there is no portable way to "unwind" the return stack to a predetermined place.

THROW also provides a convenient implementation technique for the standard words `ABORT` and `ABORT"`,  allowing an application to define, through the use of CATCH, the behavior in the event of a system `ABORT`.

This sample implementation of `CATCH` and `THROW` uses the non-standard words described below. They or  their equivalents are available in many systems. Other implementation strategies, including directly saving  the value of `DEPTH`, are possible if such words are not available.

<miniterm>

||SP@||
( -- addr )
returns the address corresponding to the top of data stack.

||SP!||
( addr -- )
sets the stack pointer to addr, thus restoring the stack depth to the same depth that  existed just before addr was acquired by executing `SP@`.

||RP@||
( -- addr )
returns the address corresponding to the top of return stack.

||RP!||
( addr -- )
sets the return stack pointer to addr, thus restoring the return stack depth to the same  depth that existed just before addr was acquired by executing `RP@`.

</miniterm>

    VARIABLE HANDLER 0 HANDLER ! \ last exception handler  
    : CATCH ( xt -- exception# | 0 ) \ return addr on stack 
        SP@ >R ( xt ) \ save data stack pointer 
        HANDLER @ >R ( xt ) \ and previous handler 
        RP@ HANDLER ! ( xt ) \ set current handler 
        EXECUTE ( ) \ execute returns if no THROW 
        R> HANDLER ! ( ) \ restore previous handler 
        R> DROP ( ) \ discard saved stack ptr 
        0 ( 0 ) \ normal completion 
    ;
    : THROW ( ??? exception# -- ??? exception# ) 
        ?DUP IF ( exc# ) \ 0 THROW is no-op 
            HANDLER @ RP! ( exc# ) \ restore prev return stack 
            R> HANDLER ! ( exc# ) \ restore prev handler 
            R> SWAP >R ( saved-sp ) \ exc# on return stack 
            SP! DROP R> ( exc# ) \ restore stack 
            \ Return to the caller of CATCH because return 
            \ stack is restored to the state that existed 
            \ when CATCH began execution 
        THEN 
    ;

In a multi-tasking system, the `HANDLER` variable should be in the per-task variable area (i.e., a user  variable).

This sample implementation does not explicitly handle the case in which `CATCH` has never been called (i.e.,  the `ABORT` behavior). One solution is to add the following code after the `IF` in `THROW`:  

    HANDLER @ 0= IF ( empty the stack ) QUIT THEN  

Another solution is to execute `CATCH` within `QUIT`, so that there is always an "exception handler of last  resort" present. For example:   

    : QUIT 
        ( empty the return stack and ) 
        ( set the input source to the user input device ) 
        POSTPONE [ 
        BEGIN 
            REFILL 
        WHILE 
            ['] INTERPRET CATCH 
            CASE 
                0 OF STATE @ 0= IF ." OK" THEN CR ENDOF 
                -1 OF ( Aborted) ENDOF 
                -2 OF ( display message from ABORT" ) ENDOF 
                ( default ) DUP ." Exception # " .
            ENDCASE 
        REPEAT BYE 
    ;
 
This example assumes the existance of a system-implementation word `INTERPRET` that embodies the text  interpreter semantics described in 3.4 The Forth text interpreter. Note that this implementation of `QUIT` automatically handles the emptying of the stack and return stack, due to `THROW`’s inherent restoration of the  data and return stacks. Given this definition of `QUIT`, it’s easy to define:  

    : ABORT -1 THROW ; 

In systems with other stacks in addition to the data and return stacks, the implementation of `CATCH` and  `THROW` must save and restore those stack pointers as well. Such an "extended version" can be built on top  of this basic implementation. For example, with another stack pointer accessed with `FP@` and `FP!` only  `CATCH` needs to be redefined:  

    : CATCH ( xt -- exception# | 0 ) 
        FP@ >R CATCH R> OVER IF FP! ELSE DROP THEN ; 

No change to `THROW` is necessary in this case. Note that, as with all redefinitions, the redefined version of  `CATCH` will only be available to definitions compiled after the redefinition of `CATCH`.

`CATCH` and `THROW` provide a convenient way for an implementation to "clean up" the state of open files if  an exception occurs during the text interpretation of a file with `INCLUDE-FILE`. The implementation of  `INCLUDE-FILE` may guard (with `CATCH`) the word that performs the text interpretation, and if `CATCH` returns an exception code, the file may be closed and the exception re`THROW`n so that the files being  included at an outer nesting level may be closed also. Note that the Standard allows, but does not require,  `INCLUDE-FILE` to close its open files if an exception occurs. However, it does require `INCLUDE-FILE` to unnest the input source specification if an exception is THROWn.

### A.9.3 Additional usage requirements 

One important use of an exception handler is to maintain program control under many conditions which  `ABORT`. This is practicable only if a range of codes is reserved. Note that an application may overload  many standard words in such a way as to `THROW` ambiguous conditions not normally `THROW`n by a  particular system.

#### A.9.3.6 Exception handling 

The method of accomplishing this coupling is implementation dependent. For example, LOAD could "know" about `CATCH` and `THROW` (by using `CATCH` itself, for example), or `CATCH` and `THROW` could "know" about `LOAD` (by maintaining input source nesting information in a data structure known to `THROW`, for example). Under these circumstances it is not possible for a Standard Program to define words such as  `LOAD` in a completely portable way.

### A.9.6 Glossary 

##### A.9.6.1.2275 THROW 

If THROW is executed with a non zero argument, the effect is as if the corresponding `CATCH` had returned it.  In that case, the stack depth is the same as it was just before `CATCH` began execution. The values of the *i\*x* stack arguments could have been modified arbitrarily during the execution of xt. In general, nothing useful  may be done with those stack items, but since their number is known (because the stack depth is  deterministic), the application may `DROP` them to return to a predictable stack state.

Typical use: 

    : could-fail ( -- char ) 
        KEY DUP [CHAR] Q = IF 1 THROW THEN ; 
    : do-it ( a b -- c) 2DROP could-fail ; 
    : try-it ( --) 
        1 2 ['] do-it CATCH IF 
            ( x1 x2 ) 2DROP ." There was an exception" CR 
        ELSE ." The character was " EMIT CR 
        THEN 
    ; 
    : retry-it ( -- ) 
        BEGIN 1 2 ['] do-it CATCH WHILE 
            ( x1 x2) 2DROP ." Exception, keep trying" CR 
        REPEAT ( char ) 
        ." The character was " EMIT CR 
    ; 

## A.10 The optional Facility word set 

### A.10.6 Glossary 

##### A.10.6.1.0742 AT-XY 

Most implementors supply a method of positioning a cursor on a CRT screen, but there is great variance in  names and stack arguments. This version is supported by at least one major vendor.

##### A.10.6.1.1755 KEY? 

The Technical Committee has gone around several times on the stack effects. Whatever is decided will  violate somebody’s practice and penalize some machine. This way doesn’t interfere with type-ahead on  some systems, while requiring the implementation of a single-character buffer on machines where polling  the keyboard inevitably results in the destruction of the character.

Use of `KEY` or `KEY?` indicates that the application does not wish to bother with non-character events, so  they are discarded, in anticipation of eventually receiving a valid character. Applications wishing to handle  non-character events must use EKEY and EKEY?. It is possible to mix uses of `KEY?` / `KEY` and `EKEY?` /  `EKEY` within a single application, but the application must use `KEY?` and `KEY` only when it wishes to  discard non-character events until a valid character is received.

##### A.10.6.2.1305 EKEY 

`EKEY` provides a standard word to access a system-dependent set of "raw" keyboard events, including  events corresponding to members of the standard character set, events corresponding to other members of  the implementation-defined character set, and keystrokes that do not correspond to members of the  character set.

`EKEY` assumes no particular numerical correspondence between particular event code values and the values  representing standard characters. On some systems, this may allow two separate keys that correspond to the  same standard character to be distinguished from one another.

In systems that combine both keyboard and mouse events into a single "event stream", the single number  returned by `EKEY` may be inadequate to represent the full range of input possibilities. In such systems, a  single "event record" may include a time stamp, the x,y coordinates of the mouse position, the keyboard  state, and the state of the mouse buttons. In such systems, it might be appropriate for `EKEY` to return the  address of an "event record" from which the other information could be extracted.

Also, consider a hypothetical Forth system running under MS-DOS on a PC-compatible computer. Assume  that the implementation-defined character set is the "normal" 8-bit PC character set. In that character set,  the codes from 0 to 127 correspond to ASCII characters. The codes from 128 to 255 represent characters  from various non-English languages, mathematical symbols, and some graphical symbols used for line  drawing. In addition to those characters, the keyboard can generate various other "scan codes", representing  such non-character events as arrow keys and function keys.

There may be multiple keys, with different scan codes, corresponding to the same standard character. For  example, the character representing the number "1" often appears both in the row of number keys above the  alphabetic keys, and also in the separate numeric keypad.

When a program asks the MS-DOS operating system for a keyboard event, it receives either a single non-zero byte, representing a character, or a zero byte followed by a "scan code" byte, representing a non character keyboard event (e.g., a function key).

`EKEY` represents each keyboard event as a single number, rather than as a sequence of numbers. For the  system described above, the following would be a reasonable implementation of `EKEY` and related words:  

The MAX-CHAR environmental query would return 255.

Assume the existence of a word DOS-KEY ( -- char ) which executes the MS-DOS "Direct STDIN  Input" system call (Interrupt 21h, Function 07h) and a word `DOS-KEY?` ( -- flag) which executes the  MS-DOS "Check STDIN Status" system call (Interrupt 21h, Function 0Bh).

    : EKEY? ( -- flag ) DOS-KEY? 0<> ; 
    : EKEY ( -- u ) DOS-KEY ?DUP 0= IF DOS-KEY 256 + THEN ; 
    : EKEY>CHAR ( u -- u false | char true ) 
        DUP 255 > IF ( u ) 
            DUP 259 = IF \ 259 is Ctrl-@ (ASCII NUL) 
                DROP 0 TRUE EXIT \ so replace with character 
            THEN FALSE EXIT \ otherwise extended character 
        THEN TRUE \ normal extended ASCII char.
    ; 
    VARIABLE PENDING-CHAR -1 PENDING-CHAR !  
    : KEY? ( -- flag ) 
        PENDING-CHAR @ 0< IF 
            BEGIN EKEY? WHILE 
                EKEY EKEY>CHAR IF 
                    PENDING-CHAR ! TRUE EXIT 
                THEN DROP 
            REPEAT FALSE EXIT 
        THEN TRUE 
    ; 
    : KEY ( -- char ) 
        PENDING-CHAR @ 0< IF 
            BEGIN EKEY EKEY>CHAR 0= WHILE 
                DROP 
            REPEAT EXIT 
        THEN PENDING-CHAR @ -1 PENDING-CHAR ! 
    ;
 
This is a full-featured implementation, providing the application program with an easy way to either handle  non-character events (with `EKEY`), or to ignore them and to only consider "real" characters (with `KEY`).

Note that `EKEY` maps scan codes from 0 to 255 into numbers from 256 to 511. `EKEY` maps the number 259, representing the keyboard combination Ctrl-Shift-@, to the character whose numerical value is 0 (ASCII NUL). Many ASCII keyboards generate ASCII NUL for Ctrl-Shift-@, so we use that key combination for ASCII NUL (which is otherwise unavailable from MS-DOS, because the zero byte signifies  that another scan-code byte follows).

One consequence of using the "Direct STDIN Input" system call (function 7) instead of the "STDIN Input"  system call (function 8) is that the normal DOS "Ctrl-C interrupt" behavior is disabled when the system is  waiting for input (Ctrl-C would still cause an interrupt while characters are being output). On the other  hand, if the "STDIN Input" system call (function 8) were used to implement `EKEY`, Ctrl-C interrupts would  be enabled, but Ctrl-Shift-@ would also cause an interrupt, because the operating system would treat the  second byte of the 0,3 sequence as a Ctrl-C, even though the 3 is really a scan code and not a character.

One "best of both worlds" solution is to use function 8 for the first byte received by `EKEY`, and function 7  for the scan code byte. For example:  

    : EKEY ( -- u ) 
        DOS-KEY-FUNCTION-8 ?DUP 0= IF 
            DOS-KEY-FUNCTION-7 DUP 3 = IF 
                DROP 0 ELSE 256 + 
            THEN 
        THEN 
    ;
 
Of course, if the Forth implementor chooses to pass Ctrl-C through to the program, without using it for its  usual interrupt function, then DOS function 7 is appropriate in both cases (and some additional care must be  taken to prevent a typed-ahead Ctrl-C from interrupting the Forth system during output operations).

A Forth system might also choose a simpler implementation of KEY, without implementing `EKEY`, as  follows:  

    : KEY ( -- char ) DOS-KEY ; 
    : KEY? ( -- flag ) DOS-KEY? 0<> ; 

The disadvantages of the simpler version are:  

a) An application program that uses `KEY`, expecting to receive only valid characters, might receive a  sequence of bytes (e.g., a zero byte followed by a byte with the same numerical value as the letter "A")  that appears to contain a valid character, even though the user pressed a key (e.g., function key 4) that  does not correspond to any valid character.

b) An application program that wishes to handle non-character events will have to execute `KEY` twice  if it returns zero the first time. This might appear to be a reasonable and easy thing to do. However,  such code is not portable to other systems that do not use a zero byte as an "escape" code. Using the  `EKEY` approach, the algorithm for handling keyboard events can be the same for all systems; the system  dependencies can be reduced to a table or set of constants listing the system-dependent key codes used  to access particular application functions. Without `EKEY`, the algorithm, not just the table, is likely to  be system dependent.

Another approach to `EKEY` on MS-DOS is to use the BIOS "Read Keyboard Status" function (Interrupt 16h, Function 01h) or the related "Check Keyboard" function (Interrupt 16h, Function 11h). The advantage of this function is that it allows the program to distinguish between different keys that correspond to the  same character (e.g. the two "1" keys). The disadvantage is that the BIOS keyboard functions read only the  keyboard. They cannot be "redirected" to another "standard input" source, as can the DOS STDIN Input  functions.

##### A.10.6.2.1306 EKEY>CHAR 

`EKEY>CHAR` translates a keyboard event into the corresponding member of the character set, if such a  correspondence exists for that event.

It is possible that several different keyboard events may correspond to the same character, and other  keyboard events may correspond to no character.

##### A.10.6.2.1325 EMIT? 

An indefinite delay is a device related condition, such as printer off-line, that requires operator intervention  before the device will accept new data.

##### A.10.6.2.1905 MS 

Although their frequencies vary, every system has a clock. Since many programs need to time intervals, this  word is offered. Use of milliseconds as an internal unit of time is a practical "least common denominator"  external unit. It is assumed implementors will use "clock ticks" (whatever size they are) as an internal unit  and convert as appropriate.

##### A.10.6.2.2292 TIME&DATE 

Most systems have a real-time clock/calendar. This word gives portable access to it.
## A.11 The optional File-Access word set 

Many Forth systems support access to a host file system, and many of these support interpretation of Forth  from source text files. The Forth-83 Standard did not address host OS files. Nevertheless, a degree of  similarity exists among modern implementations.

For example, files must be opened and closed, created and deleted. Forth file-system implementations  differ mostly in the treatment and disposition of the exception codes, and in the format of the file identification strings. The underlying mechanism for creating file-control blocks might or might not be  visible. We have chosen to keep it invisible.

Files must also be read and written. Text files, if supported, must be read and written one line at a time.  Interpretation of text files implies that they are somehow integrated into the text interpreter input  mechanism. These and other requirements have shaped the file-access extensions word set.

Most of the existing implementations studied use simple English words for common host file functions:  OPEN, CLOSE, READ, etc. Although we would have preferred to do likewise, there were so many minor  variations in implementation of these words that adopting any particular meaning would have broken much  existing code. We have used names with a suffix -FILE for most of these words. We encourage  implementors to conform their single-word primitives to the ANS behaviors, and hope that if this is done on  a widespread basis we can adopt better definition names in a future standard.

Specific rationales for members of this word set follow.

### A.11.3 Additional usage requirements 

#### A.11.3.2 Blocks in files 

Many systems reuse file identifiers; when a file is closed, a subsequently opened file may be given the same  identifier. If the original file has blocks still in block buffers, these will be incorrectly associated with the  newly opened file with disastrous results. The block buffer system must be flushed to avoid this.

### A.11.6 Glossary 

##### A.11.6.1.0765 BIN 

Some operating systems require that files be opened in a different mode to access their contents as an  unstructured stream of binary data rather than as a sequence of lines.

The arguments to `READ-FILE` and `WRITE-FILE` are arrays of character storage elements, each  element consisting of at least 8 bits. The Technical Committee intends that, in BIN mode, the contents of  these storage elements can be written to a file and later read back without alteration. The Technical  Committee has declined to address issues regarding the impact of "wide" characters on the File and Block  word sets.

##### A.11.6.1.1010 CREATE-FILE 

Typical use:  

    : X .. S" TEST.FTH" R/W CREATE-FILE ABORT" CREATE-FILE FAILED" ... ; 

##### A.11.6.1.1717 INCLUDE-FILE 

Here are two implementation alternatives for saving the input source specification in the presence of text file  input:  

1) Save the file position (as returned by `FILE-POSITION`) of the beginning of the line being interpreted. To restore the input source specification, seek to that position and re-read the line into the  input buffer.

2) Allocate a separate line buffer for each active text input file, using that buffer as the input buffer.  This method avoids the "seek and reread" step, and allows the use of "pseudo-files" such as pipes and  other sequential-access-only communication channels.

##### A.11.6.1.1718 INCLUDED 

Typical use: ... S" filename" INCLUDED ...

##### A.11.6.1.1970 OPEN-FILE 

Typical use:  

    : X .. S" TEST.FTH" R/W OPEN-FILE ABORT" OPEN-FILE FAILED" ... ; 

##### A.11.6.1.2080 READ-FILE 

A typical sequential file-processing algorithm might look like:  

    BEGIN                   ( )  
        ... READ-FILE THROW ( length ) 
    ?DUP WHILE              ( length ) 
        ...                 ( ) 
    REPEAT                  ( )  

In this example, `THROW` is used to handle (unexpected) exception conditions, which are reported as non-zero values of the ior return value from `READ-FILE`. End-of-file is reported as a zero value of the  "length" return value.

##### A.11.6.1.2090 READ-LINE 

Implementations are allowed to store the line terminator in the memory buffer in order to allow the use of  line reading functions provided by host operating systems, some of which store the terminator. Without this  provision, a temporary buffer might be needed. The two-character limitation is sufficient for the vast  majority of existing operating systems. Implementations on host operating systems whose line terminator  sequence is longer than two characters may have to take special action to prevent the storage of more than  two terminator characters.

Standard Programs may not depend on the presence of any such terminator sequence in the buffer.

A typical line-oriented sequential file-processing algorithm might look like:  

    BEGIN               ( )  
        . . . READ-LINE THROW ( length not-eof-flag ) 
    WHILE               ( length )  
        . . .           ( ) 
    REPEAT DROP         ( )  

In this example, THROW is used to handle (unexpected) I/O exception condition, which are reported as non-zero values of the "ior" return value from READ-LINE.

READ-LINE needs a separate end-of-file flag because empty (zero-length) lines are a routine occurrence,  so a zero-length line cannot be used to signify end-of-file.

##### A.11.6.1.2165 S" 

Typical use: ... S" ccc" ...

The interpretation semantics for `S"` are intended to provide a simple mechanism for entering a string in the  interpretation state. Since an implementation may choose to provide only one buffer for interpreted strings,  an interpreted string is subject to being overwritten by the next execution of `S"` in interpretation state. It is  intended that no standard words other than `S"` should in themselves cause the interpreted string to be  overwritten. However, since words such as `EVALUATE`, `LOAD`, `INCLUDE-FILE` and `INCLUDED` can  result in the interpretation of arbitrary text, possibly including instances of `S"`, the interpreted string may be  invalidated by some uses of these words.

When the possibility of overwriting a string can arise, it is prudent to copy the string to a "safe" buffer  allocated by the application.

Programs wishing to parse in the fashion of `S"` are advised to use `PARSE` or `WORD` `COUNT` instead of `S"`,  preventing the overwriting of the interpreted string buffer.

## A.12 The optional Floating-Point word set 

The Technical Committee has considered many proposals dealing with the inclusion and makeup of the  Floating-Point Word Sets in ANS Forth. Although it has been argued that ANS Forth should not address  floating-point arithmetic and numerous Forth applications do not need floating-point, there are a growing  number of important Forth applications from spread sheets to scientific computations that require the use of  floating-point arithmetic. Initially the Technical Committee adopted proposals that made the Forth Vendors  Group Floating-Point Standard, first published in 1984, the framework for inclusion of Floating-Point in  ANS Forth. There is substantial common practice and experience with the Forth Vendors Group Floating-Point Standard. Subsequently the Technical Committee adopted proposals that placed the basic floating-point arithmetic, stack and support words in the Floating-Point word set and the floating-point  transcendental functions in the Floating-Point Extensions word set. The Technical Committee also adopted  proposals that:  

- changed names for clarity and consistency; e.g., `REALS` to `FLOATS`, and `REAL+` to `FLOAT+` .
- removed words; e.g., `FPICK` .
- added words for completeness and increased functionality; e.g., `FSINCOS`, `F~`, `DF@`, `DF!`, `SF@` and `SF!` 

Several issues concerning the Floating-Point word set were resolved by consensus in the Technical  Committee:  

<miniterm>

||Floating-point stack:||
By default the floating-point stack is separate from the data and return stacks;  however, an implementation may keep floating-point numbers on the data stack. A program can  determine whether floating-point numbers are kept on the data stack by passing the string `FLOATING-STACK` to `ENVIRONMENT?` It is the experience of several members of the Technical Committee that  with proper coding practices it is possible to write floating-point code that will run identically on  systems with a separate floating-point stack and with floating-point numbers kept on the data stack.

||Floating-point input:||
The current base must be `DECIMAL`. Floating-point input is not allowed in an  arbitrary base. All floating-point numbers to be interpreted by an ANS Forth system must contain the  exponent indicator "E" (see **12.3.7  Text interpreter input number conversion**). Consensus in the  Technical Committee deemed this form of floating-point input to be in more common use than the  alternative that would have a floating-point input mode that would allow numbers with embedded  decimal points to be treated as floating-point numbers.

||Floating-point representation:||
Although the format and precision of the significand and the format and  range of the exponent of a floating-point number are implementation defined in ANS Forth, the  Floating-Point Extensions word set contains the words `DF@`, `SF@`, `DF!`, and `SF!` for fetching and  storing double- and single-precision IEEE floating-point-format numbers to memory. The IEEE  floating-point format is commonly used by numeric math co-processors and for exchange of floating-point data between programs and systems.

</miniterm>

### A.12.3 Additional usage requirements 

#### A.12.3.5 Address alignment 

In defining custom floating-point data structures, be aware that CREATE doesn’t necessarily leave the data  space pointer aligned for various floating-point data types. Programs may comply with the requirement for  the various kinds of floating-point alignment by specifying the appropriate alignment both at compile-time  and execution time. For example:  

    : FCONSTANT ( F: r -- ) 
        CREATE FALIGN HERE 1 FLOATS ALLOT F! 
        DOES> ( F: -- r ) FALIGNED F@ ; 

#### A.12.3.7 Text interpreter input number conversion 

The Technical Committee has more than once received the suggestion that the text interpreter in Standard  Forth systems should treat numbers that have an embedded decimal point, but no exponent, as floating-point  numbers rather than double cell numbers. This suggestion, although it has merit, has always been voted  down because it would break too much existing code; many existing implementations put the full digit string  on the stack as a double number and use other means to inform the application of the location of the decimal  point.

### A.12.6 Glossary 

##### A.12.6.1.0558 >FLOAT 

`>FLOAT` enables programs to read floating-point data in legible ASCII format. It accepts a much broader syntax than does the text interpreter since the latter defines rules for composing source programs whereas `>FLOAT` defines rules for accepting data. >FLOAT is defined as broadly as is feasible to permit input of data from ANS Forth systems as well as other widely used standard programming environments.

This is a synthesis of common FORTRAN practice. Embedded spaces are explicitly forbidden in much  scientific usage, as are other field separators such as comma or slash.

While `>FLOAT` is not required to treat a string of blanks as zero, this behavior is strongly encouraged, since  a future version of ANS Forth may include such a requirement.

##### A.12.6.1.1427 F.

For example, 1E3 F. displays 1000. .

##### A.12.6.1.2143 REPRESENT 

This word provides a primitive for floating-point display. Some floating-point formats, including those  specified by IEEE-754, allow representations of numbers outside of an implementation-defined range.  These include plus and minus infinities, denormalized numbers, and others. In these cases we expect that  REPRESENT will usually be implemented to return appropriate character strings, such as "+infinity" or  "nan", possibly truncated.

##### A.12.6.2.1489 FATAN2 

`FSINCOS` and `FATAN2` are a complementary pair of operators which convert angles to 2-vectors and vice-versa. They are essential to most geometric and physical applications since they correctly and  unambiguously handle this conversion in all cases except null vectors, even when the tangent of the angle  would be infinite.

FSINCOS returns a Cartesian unit vector in the direction of the given angle, measured counter-clockwise  from the positive X-axis. The order of results on the stack, namely y underneath x, permits the 2-vector  data type to be additionally viewed and used as a ratio approximating the tangent of the angle. Thus the  phrase `FSINCOS` `F/` is functionally equivalent to `FTAN`, but is useful over only a limited and  discontinuous range of angles, whereas `FSINCOS` and `FATAN2` are useful for all angles. This ordering has  been found convenient for nearly two decades, and has the added benefit of being easy to remember. A  corollary to this observation is that vectors in general should appear on the stack in this order.

The argument order for `FATAN2` is the same, converting a vector in the conventional representation to a  scalar angle. Thus, for all angles, `FSINCOS` `FATAN2` is an identity within the accuracy of the arithmetic  and the argument range of `FSINCOS`. Note that while `FSINCOS` always returns a valid unit vector,  `FATAN2` will accept any non-null vector. An ambiguous condition exists if the vector argument to `FATAN2` has zero magnitude.

##### A.12.6.2.1516 FEXPM1 

This function allows accurate computation when its arguments are close to zero, and provides a useful base  for the standard exponential functions. Hyperbolic functions such as cosh(x) can be efficiently and  accurately implemented by using `FEXPM1`; accuracy is lost in this function for small values of x if the word  `FEXP` is used.

An important application of this word is in finance; say a loan is repaid at 15% per year; what is the daily  rate? On a computer with single precision (six decimal digit) accuracy:  

1. Using `FLN` and `FEXP`: 

    FLN of 1.15 = 0.139762,  
    divide by 365 = 3.82910E-4,  
    form the exponent using FEXP = 1.00038, and  
    subtract one (1) and convert to percentage = 0.038%.

Thus we only have two digit accuracy.

2. Using `FLNP1` and `FEXPM1`: 

    FLNP1 of 0.15 = 0.139762, (this is the same value as in the first example, although with the argument  closer to zero it may not be so)  
    divide by 365 = 3.82910E-4,  
    form the exponent and subtract one (1) using FEXPM1 = 3.82983E-4, and  
    convert to percentage = 0.0382983%.

This is full six digit accuracy.

The presence of this word allows the hyperbolic functions to be computed with usable accuracy. For  example, the hyperbolic sine can be defined as:  

    : FSINH ( r1 -- r2 ) 
        FEXPM1 FDUP FDUP 1.0E0 F+ F/ F+ 2.0E0 F/ ; 

##### A.12.6.2.1554 FLNP1 

This function allows accurate compilation when its arguments are close to zero, and provides a useful base  for the standard logarithmic functions. For example, FLN can be implemented as:  

    : FLN 1.0E0 F- FLNP1 ; 

**See: A.12.6.2.1516 FEXPM1**.

##### A.12.6.2.1616 FSINCOS 

See: **A.12.6.2.1489 FATAN2**.

##### A.12.6.2.1640 F~ 

This provides the three types of "floating point equality" in common use -- "close" in absolute terms, exact  equality as represented, and "relatively close".

## A.13 The optional Locals word set 

The Technical Committee has had a problem with locals. It has been argued forcefully that ANS Forth  should say nothing about locals since:  

- there is no clear accepted practice in this area; 
- not all Forth programmers use them or even know what they are; and 
- few implementations use the same syntax, let alone the same broad usage rules and general approaches.

It has also been argued, it would seem equally forcefully, that the lack of any standard approach to locals is  precisely the reason for this lack of accepted practice since locals are at best non-trivial to implement in a  portable and useful way. It has been further argued that users who have elected to become dependent on  locals tend to be locked into a single vendor and have little motivation to join the group that it is hoped will  "broadly accept" ANS Forth unless the Standard addresses their problems.

Since the Technical Committee has been unable to reach a strong consensus on either leaving locals out or  on adopting any particular vendor’s syntax, it has sought some way to deal with an issue that it has been  unable to simply dismiss. Realizing that no single mechanism or syntax can simultaneously meet the desires  expressed in all the locals proposals that have been received, it has simplified the problem statement to be to  define a locals mechanism that:  

- is independent of any particular syntax; 
- is user extensible; 
- enables use of arbitrary identifiers, local in scope to a single definition; 
- supports the fundamental cell size data types of Forth; and 
- works consistently, especially with respect to re-entrancy and recursion.

This appears to the Technical Committee to be what most of those who actively use locals are trying to  achieve with them, and it is at present the consensus of the Technical Committee that if ANS Forth has  anything to say on the subject this is an acceptable thing for it to say.

This approach, defining `(LOCAL)`, is proposed as one that can be used with a small amount of user coding  to implement some, but not all, of the locals schemes in use. The following coding examples illustrate how  it can be used to implement two syntaxes.

- The syntax defined by this Standard and used in the systems of Creative Solutions, Inc.: 

    : LOCALS| ( "name...name |" -- ) 
        BEGIN 
            BL WORD COUNT OVER C@ 
            [CHAR] | - OVER 1 - OR WHILE 
            (LOCAL) 
        REPEAT 2DROP 0 0 (LOCAL) 
    ; IMMEDIATE 
    : EXAMPLE ( n -- n**2 n**3 ) 
        LOCALS| N | N DUP N * DUP N * ; 

- A proposed syntax: ( LOCAL name ) with additional usage rules: 

    : LOCAL ( "name" -- ) BL WORD COUNT (LOCAL) ; IMMEDIATE 
    : END-LOCALS ( -- ) 0 0 (LOCAL) ; IMMEDIATE 
    : EXAMPLE ( n -- n n**2 n**3 ) 
        LOCAL N END-LOCALS N DUP N * DUP N * ; 

Other syntaxes can be implemented, although some will admittedly require considerably greater effort or in  some cases program conversion. Yet other approaches to locals are completely incompatible due to gross  differences in usage rules and in some cases even scope identifiers. For example, the complete local scheme  in use at Johns Hopkins had elaborate semantics that cannot be duplicated in terms of this model.

To reinforce the intent of section 13, here are two examples of actual use of locals. The first illustrates  correct usage:  

a) : { ( "name ... }" - )  
        BEGIN BL WORD COUNT 
            OVER C@ [CHAR] } - OVER 1 - OR WHILE 
            (LOCAL) 
        REPEAT 2DROP 0 0 (LOCAL) 
    ; IMMEDIATE 

b) : JOE ( a b c -- n )  
        >R 2* R> 2DUP + 0 
        { ANS 2B+C C 2B A } 
        2 0 DO 1 ANS + I + TO ANS ANS . CR LOOP 
        ANS . 2B+C . C . 2B . A . CR ANS 
    ; 

c) 100 300 10 JOE .

The word \{ at a) defines a local declaration syntax that surrounds the list of locals with braces. It doesn’t  do anything fancy, such as reordering locals or providing initial values for some of them, so locals are  initialized from the stack in the default order. The definition of JOE at b) illustrates a use of this syntax.  Note that work is performed at execution time in that definition before locals are declared. It’s OK to use  the return stack as long as whatever is placed there is removed before the declarations begin.

Note that before declaring locals, B is doubled, a subexpression (2B+C) is computed, and an initial value (zero) for ANS is provided. After locals have been declared, JOE proceeds to use them. Note that locals may be accessed and updated within do-loops. The effect of interpreting line c) is to display the following  values:  

    1 (ANS the first time through the loop), 
    3 (ANS the second time), 
    3 (ANS), 610 (2B+C), 10 (C), 600 (2B), 100 (A), and 
    3 (ANS left on the stack by JOE).

The names of the locals vanish after JOE has been compiled. The storage and meaning of locals appear  when JOE’s locals are declared and vanish as JOE returns to its caller at ; (semicolon).

A second set of examples illustrates various things that break the rules. We assume that the definitions of  LOCAL and END-LOCALS above are present, along with { from the preceding example.

d) : ZERO 0 POSTPONE LITERAL POSTPONE LOCAL ; IMMEDIATE  

e) : MOE ( a b )  
        ZERO TEMP LOCAL B 1+ LOCAL A+ ZERO ANSWER ; 

f) : BOB ( a b c d ) \{ D C } \{ B A } ;  

Here are two definitions with various violations of rule 13.3.3.2a. In e) the declaration of TEMP is legal and  creates a local whose initial value is zero. It’s OK because the executable code that ZERO generates  precedes the first use of (LOCAL) in the definition. However, the 1+ preceding the declaration of A+ is  illegal. Likewise the use of ZERO to define ANSWER is illegal because it generates executable code  between uses of (LOCAL). Finally, MOE terminates illegally (no END-LOCALS). BOB inf) violates the  rule against declaring two sets of locals.

g) : ANN ( a b -- b ) DUP >R DUP IF \{ B A } THEN R> ;  

h) : JANE ( a b -- n ) \{ B A } A B + >R A B - R> / ;  

ANN in g) violates two rules. The IF ... THEN around the declaration of its locals violates 13.3.3.2b, and  the copy of B left on the return stack before declaring locals violates 13.3.3.2c. JANE in h) violates  13.3.3.2d by accessing locals after placing the sum of A and B on the return stack without first removing that sum.

i) : CHRIS ( a b)  
        { B A } ['] A EXECUTE 5 ['] B >BODY ! [ ' A ] LITERAL LEE ; 

CHRIS in i) illustrates three violations of 13.3.3.2e. The attempt to EXECUTE the local called A is  inconsistent with some implementations. The store into B via >BODY is likely to cause tragic results with  many implementations; moreover, if locals are in registers they can’t be addressed as memory no matter  what is written.

The third violation, in which an execution token for a definition’s local is passed as an argument to the word  LEE, would, if allowed, have the unpleasant implication that LEE could EXECUTE the token and obtain a  value for A from the particular execution of CHRIS that called LEE this time.

### A.13.3 Additional usage requirements 

Rule 13.3.3.2d could be relaxed without affecting the integrity of the rest of this structure. 13.3.3.2c could  not be.

13.3.3.2b forbids the use of the data stack for local storage because no usage rules have been articulated for programmer users in such a case. Of course, if the data stack is somehow employed in such a way that there  are no usage rules, then the locals are invisible to the programmer, are logically not on the stack, and the  implementation conforms.

The minimum required number of locals can (and should) be adjusted to minimize the cost of compliance  for existing users of locals.

Access to previously declared local variables is prohibited by Section 13.3.3.2d until any data placed onto  the return stack by the application has been removed, due to the possible use of the return stack for storage  of locals.

Authorization for a Standard Program to manipulate the return stack (e.g., via >R R>) while local variables  are active overly constrains implementation possibilities. The consensus of users of locals was that Local  facilities represent an effective functional replacement for return stack manipulation, and restriction of  standard usage to only one method was reasonable.

Access to Locals within DO..LOOPs is expressly permitted as an additional requirement of conforming  systems by Section 13.3.3.2g. Although words, such as (LOCALS), written by a System Implementor, may  require inside knowledge of the internal structure of the return stack, such knowledge is not required of a  user of compliant Forth systems.

### A.13.6 Glossary 

##### A.13.6.1.2295 TO 

Typical use: `x TO name` 

See: **A.6.2.2295 TO**.

##### A.13.6.2.1795 LOCALS| 

A possible implementation of this word and an example of usage is given in A.13, above. It is intended as  an example only; any implementation yielding the described semantics is acceptable.

## A.14 The optional Memory-Allocation word set 

The Memory-Allocation word set provides a means for acquiring memory other than the contiguous data  space that is allocated by ALLOT. In many operating system environments it is inappropriate for a process  to pre-allocate large amounts of contiguous memory (as would be necessary for the use of ALLOT). The  Memory-Allocation word set can acquire memory from the system at any time, without knowing in advance  the address of the memory that will be acquired.

## A.15 The optional Programming-Tools word set 

These words have been in widespread common use since the earliest Forth systems.

Although there are environmental dependencies intrinsic to programs using an assembler, virtually all Forth  systems provide such a capability. Insofar as many Forth programs are intended for real-time applications  and are intrinsically non-portable for this reason, the Technical Committee believes that providing a  standard window into assemblers is a useful contribution to Forth programmers.

Similarly, the programming aids DUMP, etc., are valuable tools even though their specific formats will differ  between CPUs and Forth implementations. These words are primarily intended for use by the programmer,  and are rarely invoked in programs.

One of the original aims of Forth was to erase the boundary between "user" and "programmer" - to give all  possible power to anyone who had occasion to use a computer. Nothing in the above labeling or remarks  should be construed to mean that this goal has been abandoned.

### A.15.6 Glossary 

##### A.15.6.1.0220 .S 

`.S` is a debugging convenience found on almost all Forth systems. It is universally mentioned in Forth texts.

##### A.15.6.1.2194 SEE 

`SEE` acts as an on-line form of documentation of words, allowing modification of words by decompiling  and regenerating with appropriate changes.

##### A.15.6.1.2465 WORDS 

`WORDS` is a debugging convenience found on almost all Forth systems. It is universally referred to in Forth  texts.

##### A.15.6.2.0470 ;CODE 

Typical use: : namex ... &lt;create> ... ;CODE ...

where namex is a defining word, and &lt;create> is CREATE or any user defined word that calls `CREATE`.

##### A.15.6.2.0930 CODE 

Some Forth systems implement the assembly function by adding an ASSEMBLER word list to the search  order, using the text interpreter to parse a postfix assembly language with lexical characteristics similar to  Forth source code. Typically, in such systems, assembly ends when a word END-CODE is interpreted.

##### A.15.6.2.1015 CS-PICK 

The intent is to reiterate a dest on the control-flow stack so that it can be resolved more than once. For  example:  

    \ Conditionally transfer control to beginning of loop 
    \ This is similar in spirit to C's "continue" statement.
    : ?REPEAT ( dest -- dest ) \ Compilation 
            ( flag -- ) \ Execution 
        0 CS-PICK POSTPONE UNTIL 
    ; IMMEDIATE 
    : XX ( -- ) \ Example use of ?REPEAT 
        BEGIN 
        ...
        flag ?REPEAT ( Go back to BEGIN if flag is false ) 
        ...
        flag ?REPEAT ( Go back to BEGIN if flag is false ) 
        ...
        flag UNTIL ( Go back to BEGIN if flag is false ) 
        ...
    ; 

##### A.15.6.2.1020 CS-ROLL 

The intent is to modify the order in which the origs and dests on the control-flow stack are to be resolved by  subsequent control-flow words. For example, WHILE could be implemented in terms of IF and CS-ROLL,  as follows:  

    : WHILE ( dest -- orig dest ) 
        POSTPONE IF 1 CS-ROLL 
    ; IMMEDIATE 

##### A.15.6.2.1580 FORGET 

    Typical use: ... FORGET name ...

FORGET assumes that all the information needed to restore the dictionary to its previous state is inferable  somehow from the forgotten word. While this may be true in simple linear dictionary models, it is difficult  to implement in other Forth systems; e.g., those with multiple address spaces. For example, if Forth is  embedded in ROM, how does FORGET know how much RAM to recover when an array is forgotten? A  general and preferred solution is provided by MARKER.

##### A.15.6.2.2531 [ELSE] 

Typical use: ... flag [IF] ... [ELSE] ... [THEN] ...

##### A.15.6.2.2532 [IF] 

Typical use: ... flag [IF] ... [ELSE] ... [THEN] ...

##### A.15.6.2.2533 [THEN] 

Typical use: ... flag [IF] ... [ELSE] ... [THEN] ...

Software that runs in several system environments often contains some source code that is environmentally  dependent. Conditional compilation - the selective inclusion or exclusion of portions of the source code at  compile time - is one technique that is often used to assist in the maintenance of such source code.

Conditional compilation is sometimes done with "smart comments" - definitions that either skip or do not  skip the remainder of the line based on some test. For example:  

    \ If 16-Bit? contains TRUE, lines preceded by 16BIT\ 
    \ will be skipped. Otherwise, they will not be skipped.
    VARIABLE 16-BIT?  
    : 16BIT\ ( -- ) 16-BIT? @ IF POSTPONE \ THEN 
    ; IMMEDIATE 

This technique works on a line by line basis, and is good for short, isolated variant code sequences.

More complicated conditional compilation problems suggest a nestable method that can encompass more  than one source line at a time. The words included in the ANS Forth optional Programming tools  extensions word set are useful for this purpose. The implementation given below works with any input  source (keyboard, EVALUATE, BLOCK, or text file).

    : [ELSE] ( -- ) 
        1 BEGIN \ level 
            BEGIN BL WORD COUNT DUP WHILE \ level adr len 
                2DUP S" [IF]" COMPARE 0= IF \ level adr len

    : [THEN] ( -- ) ; IMMEDIATE 


## A.16 The optional Search-Order word set 

Search-order specification and control mechanisms vary widely. The FIG-Forth, Forth-79, polyFORTH,  and Forth-83 vocabulary and search order mechanisms are all mutually incompatible. The complete list of  incompatible mechanisms, in use or proposed, is much longer. The ALSO/ONLY scheme described in a  Forth-83 Experimental Proposal has substantial community support. However, many consider it to be  fundamentally flawed, and oppose it vigorously.

Recognizing this variation, this Standard specifies a new "primitive" set of tools from which various  schemes may be constructed. This primitive search-order word set is intended to be a portable  "construction set" from which search-order words may be built, rather than a user interface. ALSO/ONLY or the various "vocabulary" schemes supported by the major Forth vendors can be defined in terms of the  primitive search-order word set.

The encoding for word list identifiers wid might be a small-integer index into an array of word-list  definition records, the data-space address of such a record, a user-area offset, the execution token of a  Forth-83 style sealed vocabulary, the link-field address of the first definition in a word list, or anything else.  It is entirely up to the system implementor.

In some systems the interpretation of numeric literals is controlled by including "pseudo word lists" that  recognize numbers at the end of the search order. This technique is accommodated by the "default search  order" behavior of SET-ORDER when given an argument of -1. In a system using the traditional  implementation of ALSO/ONLY , the minimum search order would be equivalent to the word ONLY.

There has never been a portable way to restore a saved search order. F83 (not Forth 83) introduced the  word PREVIOUS , which almost made it possible to "unload" the search order by repeatedly executing the  phrase CONTEXT @ PREVIOUS. The search order could be "reloaded" by repeating ALSO CONTEXT  !. Unfortunately there was no portable way to determine how many word lists were in the search order.

ANS Forth has removed the word CONTEXT because in many systems its contents refer to more than one  word list, compounding portability problems.

Note that : (colon) no longer affects the search order. The previous behavior, where the compilation word  list replaces the first word list of the search order, can be emulated with the following redefinition of : (colon).

    : : GET-ORDER SWAP DROP GET-CURRENT SWAP SET-ORDER : ; 

### A.16.2 Additional terms

#### A.16.3.3 Finding definition names 

In other words, the following is not guaranteed to work:  

    : FOO ... [ ... SET-CURRENT ] ... RECURSE ...
    ; IMMEDIATE 

RECURSE, ; (semicolon), and IMMEDIATE may or may not need information stored in the compilation  word list.

### A.16.6 Glossary 

##### A.16.6.1.2192 SEARCH-WORDLIST 

The string argument to SEARCH-WORDLIST is represented by c-addr u, rather than by just c-addr as with  FIND. The committee wishes to establish c-addr u as the preferred representation of a string on the stack,  and has adopted that representation for all new functions that accept string arguments. While this decision  may cause the implementation of SEARCH-WORDLIST to be somewhat more difficult in existing systems,  the committee feels that the additional difficulty is minor.

When SEARCH-WORDLIST fails to find the word, it does not return the string, as does FIND. This is in  accordance with the general principle that Forth words consume their arguments.

##### A.16.6.2.0715 ALSO 

Here is an implementation of ALSO/ONLY in terms of the primitive search-order word set.

    WORDLIST CONSTANT ROOT ROOT SET-CURRENT  
    : DO-VOCABULARY ( -- ) \ Implementation factor 
        DOES> @ >R ( ) ( R: widnew ) 
            GET-ORDER SWAP DROP ( wid1 ... widn-1 n ) 
        R> SWAP SET-ORDER 
    ; 
    : DISCARD ( x1 .. xu u - ) \ Implementation factor 
        0 ?DO DROP LOOP \ DROP u+1 stack items 
    ; 
    CREATE FORTH FORTH-WORDLIST , DO-VOCABULARY  
    : VOCABULARY ( name -- ) WORDLIST CREATE , DO-VOCABULARY ; 
    : ALSO ( -- ) GET-ORDER OVER SWAP 1+ SET-ORDER ; 
    : PREVIOUS ( -- ) GET-ORDER SWAP DROP 1- SET-ORDER ; 
    : DEFINITIONS ( -- ) GET-ORDER OVER SET-CURRENT DISCARD ; 
    : ONLY ( -- ) ROOT ROOT 2 SET-ORDER ; 
    \ Forth-83 version; just removes ONLY 
    : SEAL ( -- ) GET-ORDER 1- SET-ORDER DROP ; 
    \ F83 and F-PC version; leaves only CONTEXT 
    : SEAL ( -- ) GET-ORDER OVER 1 SET-ORDER DISCARD ; 

The preceding definition of ONLY in terms of a "ROOT" word list follows F83 usage, and assumes that the  default search order just includes ROOT and FORTH. A more portable definition of FORTH and ONLY,  without the assumptions, is:  

    <omit the ... WORDLIST CONSTANT ROOT ... line> 
    CREATE FORTH GET-ORDER OVER , DISCARD DO-VOCABULARY  
    : ONLY ( -- ) -1 SET-ORDER ; 

Here is a simple implementation of GET-ORDER and SET-ORDER, including a corresponding definition of  FIND. The implementations of WORDLIST, SEARCH-WORDLIST, GET-CURRENT and SET-CURRENT depend on system details and are not given here.

        #ORDER @ 0 ?DO

            SEARCH-WORDLIST     ( c-addr 0; 0 | w 1 | w -1 ) 
            ?DUP IF             ( c-addr 0; w 1 | w -1 ) 
                2SWAP 2DROP LEAVE ( w 1 | w -1 ) 
            THEN                ( c-addr 0 ) 
        LOOP                    ( c-addr 0 | w 1 | w -1 ) 
    ; 

In an implementation where the dictionary search mechanism uses a hash table or lookup cache to reduce  the search time, SET-ORDER might need to reconstruct the hash table or flush the cache.

## A.17 The optional String word set 


### A.17.6 Glossary 


##### A.17.6.1.0245 /STRING 

/STRING is used to remove or add characters relative to the "left" end of the character string. Positive values of n will exclude characters from the string while negative values of n will include characters to the  left of the string. /STRING is a natural factor of WORD and commonly available.

##### A.17.6.1.0910 CMOVE

# C. Perspective (informative annex)  

The purpose of this section is to provide an informal overview of Forth as a language, illustrating its history,  most prominent features, usage, and common implementation techniques. Nothing in this section should be  considered as binding upon either implementors or users. A list of books and articles is given in Annex B for those interested in learning more about Forth.

## C.1 Features of Forth 

Forth provides an interactive programming environment. Its primary uses have been in scientific and  industrial applications such as instrumentation, robotics, process control, graphics and image processing,  artificial intelligence and business applications. The principal advantages of Forth include rapid, interactive  software development and efficient use of computer hardware.
Forth is often spoken of as a language because that is its most visible aspect. But in fact, Forth is both more  and less than a conventional programming language: more in that all the capabilities normally associated  with a large portfolio of separate programs (compilers, editors, etc.) are included within its range and less in  that it lacks (deliberately) the complex syntax characteristic of most high-level languages.
The original implementations of Forth were stand-alone systems that included functions normally performed  by separate operating systems, editors, compilers, assemblers, debuggers and other utilities. A single  simple, consistent set of rules governed this entire range of capabilities. Today, although very fast stand-alone versions are still marketed for many processors, there are also many versions that run co-resident with  conventional operating systems such as MS-DOS and UNIX.
Forth is not derived from any other language. As a result, its appearance and internal characteristics may  seem unfamiliar to new users. But Forth’s simplicity, extreme modularity, and interactive nature offset the  initial strangeness, making it easy to learn and use. A new Forth programmer must invest some time  mastering its large command repertoire. After a month or so of full-time use of Forth, that programmer  could understand more of its internal working than is possible with conventional operating systems and  compilers.
The most unconventional feature of Forth is its extensibility. The programming process in Forth consists of  defining new "words" - actually new commands in the language. These may be defined in terms of  previously defined words, much as one teaches a child concepts by explaining them in terms of previously  understood concepts. Such words are called "high-level definitions". Alternatively, new words may also be  defined in assembly code, since most Forth implementations include an assembler for the host processor.
This extensibility facilitates the development of special application languages for particular problem areas  or disciplines.
Forth’s extensibility goes beyond just adding new commands to the language. With equivalent ease, one  can also add new kinds of words. That is, one may create a word which itself will define words. In creating  such a defining word the programmer may specify a specialized behavior for the words it will create which  will be effective at compile time, at run-time, or both. This capability allows one to define specialized data  types, with complete control over both structure and behavior. Since the run-time behavior of such words  may be defined either in high-level or in code, the words created by this new defining word are equivalent to  all other kinds of Forth words in performance. Moreover, it is even easy to add new compiler directives to  implement special kinds of loops or other control structures.
Most professional implementations of Forth are written in Forth. Many Forth systems include a "meta-compiler" which allows the user to modify the internal structure of the Forth system itself.

## C.2 History of Forth 

Forth was invented by Charles H. Moore. A direct outgrowth of Moore’s work in the 1960’s, the first  program to be called Forth was written in about 1970. The first complete implementation was used in 1971  at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory’s 11-meter radio telescope in Arizona. This system was  responsible for pointing and tracking the telescope, collecting data and recording it on magnetic tape, and  supporting an interactive graphics terminal on which an astronomer could analyze previously recorded data.
The multi-tasking nature of the system allowed all these functions to be performed concurrently, without  timing conflicts or other interference - a very advanced concept for that time.
The system was so useful that astronomers from all over the world began asking for copies. Its use spread  rapidly, and in 1976 Forth was adopted as a standard language by the International Astronomical Union.
In 1973, Moore and colleagues formed FORTH, Inc. to explore commercial uses of the language. FORTH,  Inc. developed multi-user versions of Forth on minicomputers for diverse projects ranging from data bases  to scientific applications such as image processing. In 1977, FORTH, Inc. developed a version for the  newly introduced 8-bit microprocessors called "microFORTH", which was successfully used in embedded  microprocessor applications in the United States, Britain and Japan.
Stimulated by the volume marketing of microFORTH, a group of computer hobbyists in Northern California  became interested in Forth, and in 1978 formed the Forth Interest Group (FIG). They developed a  simplified model which they implemented on several microprocessors and published listings and disks at  very low cost. Interest in Forth spread rapidly, and today there are chapters of the Forth Interest Group  throughout the U.S. and in over fifteen countries.
By 1980, a number of new Forth vendors had entered the market with versions of Forth based upon the FIG  model. Primarily designed for personal computers, these relatively inexpensive Forth systems have been  distributed very widely.

## C.3 Hardware implementations of Forth 

The internal architecture of Forth simulates a computer with two stacks, a set of registers, and other  standardized features. As a result, it was almost inevitable that someone would attempt to build a hardware  representation of an actual Forth computer.
In the early 1980’s, Rockwell produced a 6502-variant with Forth primitives in on-board ROM, the  Rockwell 65F11. This chip has been used successfully in many embedded microprocessor applications. In  the mid-1980’s Zilog developed the z8800 (Super8) which offered ENTER (nest), EXIT (unnest) and  NEXT in microcode.
In 1981, Moore undertook to design a chip-level implementation of the Forth virtual machine. Working  first at FORTH, Inc. and subsequently with the start-up company NOVIX, formed to develop the chip,  Moore completed the design in 1984, and the first prototypes were produced in early 1985. More recently,  Forth processors have been developed by Harris Semiconductor Corp., Johns Hopkins University, and  others.

## C.4 Standardization efforts 

The first major effort to standardize Forth was a meeting in Utrecht in 1977. The attendees produced a  preliminary standard, and agreed to meet the following year. The 1978 meeting was also attended by  members of the newly formed Forth Interest Group. In 1979 and 1980 a series of meetings attended by both  users and vendors produced a more comprehensive standard called Forth 79.
Although Forth 79 was very influential, many Forth users and vendors found serious flaws in it, and in 1983  a new standard called Forth 83 was released.
Encouraged by the widespread acceptance of Forth 83, a group of users and vendors met in 1986 to  investigate the feasibility of an American National Standard. The X3J14 Technical Committee for ANS  Forth held its first meeting in 1987. This Standard is the result.

## C.5 Programming in Forth 

Forth is an English-like language whose elements (called "words") are named data items, procedures, and  defining words capable of creating data items with customized characteristics. Procedures and defining  words may be defined in terms of previously defined words or in machine code, using an embedded  assembler.
Forth "words" are functionally analogous to subroutines in other languages. They are also equivalent to  commands in other languages - Forth blurs the distinction between linguistic elements and functional  elements.
Words are referred to either from the keyboard or in program source by name. As a result, the term "word"  is applied both to program (and linguistic) units and to their text names. In parsing text, Forth considers a  word to be any string of characters bounded by spaces. There are a few special characters that cannot be  included in a word or start a word: space (the universal delimiter), CR (which ends terminal input), and  backspace or DEL (for backspacing during keyboard input). Many groups adopt naming conventions to  improve readability. Words encountered in text fall into three categories: defined words (i.e., Forth  routines), numbers, and undefined words. For example, here are four words:  HERE DOES> ! 8493  The first three are standard-defined words. This means that they have entries in Forth’s dictionary,  described below, explaining what Forth is to do when these words are encountered. The number "8493"  will presumably not be found in the dictionary, and Forth will convert it to binary and place it on its push-down stack for parameters. When Forth encounters an undefined word and cannot convert it to a number,  the word is returned to the user with an exception message.
Architecturally, Forth words adhere strictly to the principles of "structured programming":  - Words must be defined before they are used.
- Logical flow is restricted to sequential, conditional, and iterative patterns. Words are included to 
implement the most useful program control structures.
- The programmer works with many small, independent modules (words) for maximum testability and 
reliability.
Forth is characterized by five major elements: a dictionary, two push-down stacks, interpreters, an  assembler, and virtual storage. Although each of these may be found in other systems, the combination  produces a synergy that yields a powerful and flexible system.

### C.5.1 The Forth dictionary 

A Forth program is organized into a dictionary that occupies most of the memory used by the system. This  dictionary is a threaded list of variable-length items, each of which defines a word. The content of each  definition depends upon the type of word (data item, constant, sequence of operations, etc.). The dictionary  is extensible, usually growing toward high memory. On some multi-user systems individual users have  private dictionaries, each of which is connected to a shared system dictionary.
Words are added to the dictionary by "defining words", of which the most commonly used is : (colon).
 the 
: RECEIVE ( -- addr n ) PAD DUP 32 ACCEPT ; 
 
When : is executed, it constructs a definition for the word that follows it. In classical implementations,2 content of this definition is a string of addresses of previously defined words which will be executed in turn  whenever the word being defined is invoked. The definition is terminated by ; (semicolon). For example,  here is a definition:  The name of the new word is RECEIVE. The comment (in parentheses) indicates that it requires no  parameters and will return an address and count on the data stack. When RECEIVE is executed, it will  perform the words in the remainder of the definition in sequence. The word PAD places on the stack the  address of a scratch pad used to handle strings. DUP duplicates the top stack item, so we now have two  copies of the address. The number 32 is also placed on the stack. The word ACCEPT takes an address  > 2 footnote Other common implementation techniques include direct translation to code and other types of tokens.
(provided by PAD) and length (32) on the stack, accepts from the keyboard a string of up to 32 characters 
which will be placed at the specified address, and returns the number of characters received. The copy of  the scratch-pad address remains on the stack below the count so that the routine that called RECEIVE can  use it to pick up the received string.

### C.5.2 Push-down stacks 

The example above illustrates the use of push-down stacks for passing parameters between Forth words.
Forth maintains two push-down stacks, or LIFO lists. These provide communication between Forth words  plus an efficient mechanism for controlling logical flow. A stack contains 16-bit items on 8-bit and 16-bit  computers, and 32-bit items on 32-bit processors. Double-cell numbers occupy two stack positions, with  the most-significant part on top. Items on either stack may be addresses or data items of various kinds.
Stacks are of indefinite size, and usually grow towards low memory.
Although the structure of both stacks is the same, they have very different uses. The user interacts most  directly with the Data Stack, which contains arguments passed between words. This function replaces the  calling sequences used by conventional languages. It is efficient internally, and makes routines intrinsically  re-entrant. The second stack is called the Return Stack, as its main function is to hold return addresses for  nested definitions, although other kinds of data are sometimes kept there temporarily.
100 SAMPLES 
The use of the Data Stack (often called just "the stack") leads to a notation in which operands precede  operators. The word ACCEPT in the example above took an address and count from the stack and left  another address there. Similarly, a word called BLANK expects an address and count, and will place the  specified number of space characters (20H) in the region starting at that address. Thus,  PAD 25 BLANK  will fill the scratch region whose address is pushed on the stack by PAD with 25 spaces. Application words  are usually defined to work similarly. For example,  might be defined to record 100 measurements in a data array.
Arithmetic operators also expect values and leave results on the stack. For example, + adds the top two  numbers on the stack, replacing them both by their sum. Since results of operations are left on the stack,  operations may be strung together without a need to define variables to use for temporary storage.

### C.5.3 Interpreters 

Forth is traditionally an interpretive system, in that program execution is controlled by data items rather than  machine code. Interpreters can be slow, but Forth maintains the high speed required of real-time  applications by having two levels of interpretation.
The first is the text interpreter, which parses strings from the terminal or mass storage and looks each word  up in the dictionary. When a word is found it is executed by invoking the second level, the address  interpreter.
The second is an "address interpreter". Although not all Forth systems are implemented in this way, it was  the first and is still the primary implementation technology. For a small cost in performance, an address  interpreter can yield a very compact object program, which has been a major factor in Forth’s wide  acceptance in embedded systems and other applications where small object size is desirable.
(colon), by executing the definition pointed to by each. The content of most definitions is a sequence of 
The address interpreter processes strings of addresses or tokens compiled in definitions created by : addresses of previously defined words, which will be executed by the address interpreter in turn. Thus,  when the word RECEIVE (defined above) is executed, the word PAD, the word DUP, the literal 32, and the  word ACCEPT will be executed in sequence. The process is terminated by the semicolon. This execution  requires no dictionary searches, parsing, or other logic, because when RECEIVE was compiled the  dictionary was searched for each word, and its address (or other token) was placed in the next successive  cell of the entry. The text was not stored in memory, not even in condensed form.
The address interpreter has two important properties. First, it is fast. Although the actual speed depends  upon the specific implementation, professional implementations are highly optimized, often requiring only  one or two machine instructions per address. On most benchmarks, a good Forth implementation  substantially out-performs interpretive languages such as BASIC or LISP, and will compare favorably with  other compiled high-level languages.
Second, the address interpreter makes Forth definitions extremely compact, as each reference requires only  one cell. In comparison, a subroutine call constructed by most compilers involves instructions for handling  the calling sequence (unnecessary in Forth because of the stack) before and after a CALL or JSR instruction  and address.
Most of the words in a Forth dictionary will be defined by : (colon) and interpreted by the address  interpreter. Most of Forth itself is defined this way.

### C.5.4 Assembler 

Most implementations of Forth include a macro assembler for the CPU on which they run. By using the  defining word CODE the programmer can create a definition whose behavior will consist of executing actual  machine instructions. CODE definitions may be used to do I/O, implement arithmetic primitives, and do  other machine-dependent or time-critical processing. When using CODE the programmer has full control  over the CPU, as with any other assembler, and CODE definitions run at full machine speed.
This is an important feature of Forth. It permits explicit computer-dependent code in manageable pieces  with specific interfacing conventions that are machine-independent. To move an application to a different  processor requires re-coding only the CODE words, which will interact with other Forth words in exactly the  same manner.
Forth assemblers are so compact (typically a few Kbytes) that they can be resident in the system (as are the  compiler, editor, and other programming tools). This means that the programmer can type in short CODE definitions and execute them immediately. This capability is especially valuable in testing custom  hardware.

### C.5.5 Virtual memory 

The final unique element of Forth is its way of using disk or other mass storage as a form of "virtual  memory" for data and program source. As in the case of the address interpreter, this approach is historically  characteristic of Forth, but is by no means universal. Disk is divided into 1024-byte blocks. Two or more  buffers are provided in memory, into which blocks are read automatically when referred to. Each block has  a fixed block number, which in native systems is a direct function of its physical location. If a block is  changed in memory, it will be automatically written out when its buffer must be reused. Explicit reads and  writes are not needed; the program will find the data in memory whenever it accesses it.
Block-oriented disk handling is efficient and easy for native Forth systems to implement. As a result, blocks  provide a completely transportable mechanism for handling program source and data across both native and  co-resident versions of Forth on different host operating systems.
Definitions in program source blocks are compiled into memory by the word LOAD. Most implementations  include an editor, which formats a block for display into 16 lines of 64 characters each, and provides  commands modifying the source. An example of a Forth source block is given in Fig. C.1 below.
Source blocks have historically been an important element in Forth style. Just as Forth definitions may be  considered the linguistic equivalent of sentences in natural languages, a block is analogous to a paragraph.
A block normally contains definitions related to a common theme, such as "vector arithmetic". A comment  on the top line of the block identifies this theme. An application may selectively load the blocks it needs.
Blocks are also used to store data. Small records can be combined into a block, or large records spread over  several blocks. The programmer may allocate blocks in whatever way suits the application, and on native  systems can increase performance by organizing data to minimize disk head motion. Several Forth vendors  have developed sophisticated file and data base systems based on Forth blocks.
Versions of Forth that run co-resident with a host OS often implement blocks in host OS files. Others use  the host files exclusively. The Standard requires that blocks be available on systems providing any disk  access method, as they are the only means of referencing disk that can be transportable across both native  and co-resident implementations.

### C.5.6 Programming environment 

(which is usually the one currently under development), a process which rarely takes more than a few 
Although this Standard does not require it, most Forth systems include a resident editor. This enables a  programmer to edit source and recompile it into executable form without leaving the Forth environment. As  it is easy to organize an application into layers, it is often possible to recompile only the topmost layer  seconds.
Most Forth systems also provide resident interactive debugging aids, not only including words such as those  in 15. The optional Programming-Tools word set, but also having the ability to examine and change the  contents of VARIABLEs and other data items and to execute from the keyboard most of the component  words in both the underlying Forth system and the application under development.
The combination of resident editor, integrated debugging tools, and direct executability of most defined  words leads to a very interactive programming style, which has been shown to shorten development time.

### C.5.7 Advanced programming features 

One of the unusual characteristics of Forth is that the words the programmer defines in building an  application become integral elements of the language itself, adding more and more powerful application-oriented features.
For example, Forth includes the words VARIABLE and 2VARIABLE to name locations in which data may  be stored, as well as CONSTANT and 2CONSTANT to name single and double-cell values. Suppose a  programmer finds that an application needs arrays that would be automatically indexed through a number of  two-cell items. Such an array might be called 2ARRAY. The prefix "2" in the name indicates that each  element in this array will occupy two cells (as would the contents of a 2VARIABLE or 2CONSTANT). The  prefix "2", however, has significance only to a human and is no more significant to the text interpreter than  any other character that may be used in a definition name.
Such a definition has two parts, as there are two "behaviors" associated with this new word 2ARRAY, one at  compile time, and one at run or execute time. These are best understood if we look at how 2ARRAY is used  to define its arrays, and then how the array might be used in an application. In fact, this is how one would  design and implement this word.
100 2ARRAY RAW 50 2ARRAY REFINED 
50 elements long, and is named REFINED. In each case, a size parameter is supplied to 2ARRAY on the 
Beginning the top-down design process, here’s how we would like to use 2ARRAY:  In the first case, we are defining an array 100 elements long, whose name is RAW. In the second, the array is  data stack (Forth’s text interpreter automatically puts numbers there when it encounters them), and the name  of the word immediately follows. This order is typical of Forth defining words.
: ACQUIRE 100 0 DO DATA I RAW 2! LOOP ; 
When we use RAW or REFINED, we would like to supply on the stack the index of the element we want,  and get back the address of that element on the stack. Such a reference would characteristically take place  in a loop. Here’s a representative loop that accepts a two-cell value from a hypothetical application word  DATA and stores it in the next element of RAW:  The name of this definition is ACQUIRE. The loop begins with DO, ends with LOOP, and will execute with  index values running from 0 through 99. Within the loop, DATA gets a value. The word I returns the  current value of the loop index, which is the argument to RAW. The address of the selected element,  returned by RAW, and the value, which has remained on the stack since DATA, are passed to the word 2! (pronounced "two-store"), which stores two stack items in the address.
: 2ARRAY ( n -- ) 
 CREATE 2* CELLS ALLOT 
 DOES> ( i a -- a') SWAP 2* CELLS + ; 
2ARRAY will do when it us used to define a word such as RAW. The comment indicates that this part 
Now that we have specified exactly what 2ARRAY does and how the words it defines are to behave, we are  ready to write the two parts of its definition:  The part of the definition before the word DOES> specifies the "compile-time" behavior, that is, what the  expects a number on the stack, which is the size parameter. The word CREATE constructs the definition for  the new word. The phrase 2* CELLS converts the size parameter from two-cell units to the internal  addressing units of the system (normally characters). ALLOT then allocates the specified amount of  memory to contain the data to be associated with the newly defined array.
The second line defines the "run-time" behavior that will be shared by all words defined by 2ARRAY, such  as RAW and REFINED. The word DOES> terminates the first part of the definition and begins the second  part. A second comment here indicates that this code expects an index and an address on the stack, and will  return a different address. The index is supplied on the stack by the caller (of RAW in the example), while  the address of the content of a word defined in this way (the ALLOTted region) is automatically pushed on  top of the stack before this section of the code is to be executed. This code works as follows: SWAP reverses the order of the two stack items, to get the index on top. 2* CELLS converts the index to the  internal addressing units as in the compile-time section, to yield an offset from the beginning of the array.
The word + then adds the offset to the address of the start of the array to give the effective address, which is  the desired result.
Given this basic definition, one could easily modify it to do more sophisticated things. For example, the  compile-time code could be changed to initialize the array to zeros, spaces, or any other desired initial  value. The size of the array could be compiled at its beginning, so that the run-time code could compare the  index against it to ensure it is within range, or the entire array could be made to reside on disk instead of  main memory. None of these changes would affect the run-time usage we have specified in any way. This  illustrates a little of the flexibility available with these defining words.

### C.5.8 A programming example 

Figure C.1 contains a typical block of Forth source. It represents a portion of an application that controls a  bank of eight LEDs used as indicator lamps on an instrument, and indicates some of the ways in which Forth  definitions of various kinds combine in an application environment. This example was coded for a STD-bus  system with an 8088 processor and a millisecond clock, which is also used in the example.
The LEDs are interfaced through a single 8-bit port whose address is 40H. This location is defined as a  CONSTANT on Line 1, so that it may be referred to by name; should the address change, one need only  adjust the value of this constant. The word LIGHTS returns this address on the stack. The definition  LIGHT takes a value on the stack and sends it to the device. The nature of this value is a bit mask, whose  bits correspond directly to the individual lights.
Thus, the command 255 LIGHT will turn on all lights, while 0 LIGHT will turn them all off.

Figure C.1 - Forth source block containing words that control a set of LEDs.
Lines 4 - 7 contain a simple diagnostic of the sort one might type in from the terminal to confirm that  everything is working. The variable DELAY contains a delay time in milliseconds - execution of the word  DELAY returns the address of this variable. Two values of DELAY are set by the definitions SLOW and  FAST, using the Forth operator ! (pronounced "store") which takes a value and an address, and stores the  value in the address. The definition COUNTS runs a loop from 0 through 255 (Forth loops of this type are  exclusive at the upper end of the range), sending each value to the lights and then waiting for the period  specified by DELAY. The word @ (pronounced "fetch") fetches a value from an address, in this case the  address supplied by DELAY. This value is passed to MS, which waits the specified number of milliseconds.
The result of executing COUNTS is that the lights will count from 0 to 255 at the desired rate. To run this,  one would type:  SLOW COUNTS or FAST COUNTS  at the terminal.
Line 9 provides the capability of naming individual lamps. In this application they are being used as  indicator lights. The word LAMP is a defining word which takes as an argument a mask which represents a  particular lamp, and compiles it as a named entity. Lines 10 and 11 contain five uses of LAMP to name  particular indicators. When one of these words such as POWER is executed, the mask is returned on the  stack. In fact, the behavior of defining a value such that when the word is invoked the value is returned, is  identical to the behavior of a Forth CONSTANT. We created a new defining word here, however, to  illustrate how this would be done.
Finally, on lines 13 and 14, we have the words that will control the light panel. LAMPS is a variable that  contains the current state of the lamps. The word TOGGLE takes a mask (which might be supplied by one of  the LAMP words) and changes the state of that particular lamp, saving the result in LAMPS.
In the remainder of the application, the lamp names and TOGGLE are probably the only words that will be  executed directly. The usage there will be, for example:  POWER TOGGLE or SAMPLING TOGGLE  as appropriate, whenever the system indicators need to be changed.
The time to compile this block of code on that system was about half a second, including the time to fetch it  from disk. So it is quite practical (and normal practice) for a programmer to simply type in a definition and  try it immediately.
In addition, one always has the capability of communicating with external devices directly. The first thing  one would do when told about the lamps would be to type:  HEX FF 40 OUTPUT  and see if all the lamps come on. If not, the presumption is that something is amiss with the hardware, since  this phrase directly transmits the "all ones" mask to the device. This type of direct interaction is useful in  applications involving custom hardware, as it reduces hardware debugging time.

## C.6 Multiprogrammed systems 

Multiprogrammed Forth systems have existed since about 1970. The earliest public Forth systems  propagated the "hooks" for this capability despite the fact that many did not use them. Nevertheless the  underlying assumptions have been common knowledge in the community, and there exists considerable  common ground among these multiprogrammed systems. These systems are not just language processors,  but contain operating system characteristics as well. Many of these integrated systems run entirely stand-alone, performing all necessary operating system functions.
Some Forth systems are very fast, and can support both multi-tasking and multi-user operation even on  computers whose hardware is usually thought incapable of such advanced operation. For example, one  producer of telephone switchboards is running over 50 tasks on a Z80. There are several multiprogrammed  products for PC’s, some of which even support multiple users. Even on computers that are commonly used  in multi-user operations, the number of users that can be supported may be much larger than expected. One  large data-base application running on a single 68000 has over 100 terminals updating and querying its  data-base, with no significant degradation.
Multi-user systems may also support multiple programmers, each of which has a private dictionary, stacks,  and a set of variables controlling that task. The private dictionary is linked to a shared, re-entrant dictionary  containing all the standard Forth functions. The private dictionary can be used to develop application code  which may later be integrated into the shared dictionary. It may also be used to perform functions requiring  text interpretation, including compilation and execution of source code.

## C.7 Design and management considerations 

Just as the choice of building materials has a strong effect on the design and construction of a building, the  choice of language and operating system will affect both application design and project management  decisions.
"successive prototyping" wherein high-level Forth is used as an executable design tool, with "stubs" 
Conventionally, software projects progress through four stages: analysis, design, coding, and testing. A  Forth project necessarily incorporates these activities as well. Forth is optimized for a project-management  methodology featuring small teams of skilled professionals. Forth encourages an iterative process of  replacing lower-level routines as necessary (e.g., for hardware that isn’t built yet).
In many cases successive prototyping can produce a sounder, more useful product. As the project  progresses, implementors learn things that could lead to a better design. Wiser decisions can be made if  true relative costs are known, and often this isn’t possible until prototype code can be written and tried.
Using Forth can shorten the time required for software development, and reduce the level of effort required  for maintenance and modifications during the life of the product as well.

## C.8 Conclusion 

Forth has produced some remarkable achievements in a variety of application areas. In the last few years its  acceptance has grown rapidly, particularly among programmers looking for ways to improve their  productivity and managers looking for ways to simplify new software-development projects.

D. Compatibility analysis of ANS Forth (informative annex)  Prior to ANS Forth, there were several industry standards for Forth. The most influential are listed here in  chronological order, along with the major differences between ANS Forth and the most recent, Forth 83.

# D. Compatibility analysis of ANS Forth (informative annex)

Prior to ANS Forth, there were several industry standards for Forth.  The most influential are listed here in chronological order, along with the major differences between ANS Forth and the most recent, Forth 83.

## D.1 FIG Forth (circa 1978) 

FIG Forth was a "model" implementation of the Forth language developed by the Forth Interest Group(FIG). In FIG Forth, a relatively small number of words were implemented in processor-dependent machine language and the rest of the words were implemented in Forth. The FIG model was placed in the public  domain, and was ported to a wide variety of computer systems. Because the bulk of the FIG Forth  implementation was the same across all machines, programs written in FIG Forth enjoyed a substantial  degree of portability, even for "system-level" programs that directly manipulate the internals of the Forth  system implementation.

FIG Forth implementations were influential in increasing the number of people interested in using Forth.  Many people associate the implementation techniques embodied in the FIG Forth model with "the nature of Forth".

However, FIG Forth was not necessarily representative of commercial Forth implementations of the same  era. Some of the most successful commercial Forth systems used implementation techniques different from  the FIG Forth "model".

## D.2 Forth 79 

The Forth-79 Standard resulted from a series of meetings from 1978 to 1980, by the Forth Standards Team, an international group of Forth users and vendors (interim versions known as Forth 77 and Forth 78 were also released by the group).

Forth 79 described a set of words defined on a 16-bit, twos-complement, unaligned, linear byte-addressing  virtual machine. It prescribed an implementation technique known as "indirect threaded code", and used the  ASCII character set.

The Forth-79 Standard served as the basis for several public domain and commercial implementations,  some of which are still available and supported today.

## D.3 Forth 83 

The Forth-83 Standard, also by the Forth Standards Team, was released in 1983. Forth 83 attempted to fix  some of the deficiencies of Forth 79.

Forth 83 was similar to Forth 79 in most respects. However, Forth 83 changed the definition of several  well-defined features of Forth 79. For example, the rounding behavior of integer division, the base value of  the operands of PICK and ROLL, the meaning of the address returned by ', the compilation behavior of ',  the value of a "true" flag, the meaning of NOT, and the "chaining" behavior of words defined by  VOCABULARY were all changed. Forth 83 relaxed the implementation restrictions of Forth 79 to allow any  kind of threaded code, but it did not fully allow compilation to native machine code (this was not  specifically prohibited, but rather was an indirect consequence of another provision).

Many new Forth implementations were based on the Forth-83 Standard, but few "strictly compliant"  Forth-83 implementations exist.

Although the incompatibilities resulting from the changes between Forth 79 and Forth 83 were usually  relatively easy to fix, a number of successful Forth vendors did not convert their implementations to be  Forth 83 compliant. For example, the most successful commercial Forth for Apple Macintosh computers is  based on Forth 79.

## D.4 Recent developments 

Since the Forth-83 Standard was published, the computer industry has undergone rapid and profound  changes. The speed, memory capacity, and disk capacity of affordable personal computers have increased  by factors of more than 100. 8-bit processors have given way to 16-bit processors, and now 32-bit  processors are commonplace.

The operating systems and programming-language environments of small systems are much more powerful  than they were in the early 80’s.

The personal-computer marketplace has changed from a predominantly "hobbyist" market to a mature  business and commercial market.

Improved technology for designing custom microprocessors has resulted in the design of numerous "Forth  chips", computers optimized for the execution of the Forth language.

The market for ROM-based embedded control computers has grown substantially.

In order to take full advantage of this evolving technology, and to better compete with other programming  languages, many recent Forth implementations have ignored some of the "rules" of previous Forth  standards. In particular:  

- 32-bit Forth implementations are now common.  
- Some Forth systems adopt the address-alignment restrictions of the hardware on which they run.  
- Some Forth systems use native-code generation, microcode generation, and optimization techniques, 
rather than the traditional "threaded code".  
- Some Forth systems exploit segmented addressing architectures, placing portions of the Forth 
"dictionary" in different segments.  
- More and more Forth systems now run in the environment of another "standard" operating system, 
using OS text files for source code, rather than the traditional Forth "blocks".  
- Some Forth systems allow external operating system software, windowing software, terminal 
concentrators, or communications channels to handle or preprocess user input, resulting in deviations  from the input editing, character set availability, and screen management behavior prescribed by  Forth 83.  

Competitive pressure from other programming languages (predominantly "C") and from other Forth  vendors have led Forth vendors to optimizations that do not fit in well with the "virtual machine model"  implied by existing Forth standards.

## D.5 ANS Forth approach 

The ANS Forth committee addressed the serious fragmentation of the Forth community caused by the  differences between Forth 79 and Forth 83, and the divergence from either of these two industry standards  caused by marketplace pressures.

Consequently, the committee has chosen to base its compatibility decisions not upon a strict comparison  with the Forth-83 Standard, but instead upon consideration of the variety of existing implementations,  especially those with substantial user bases and/or considerable success in the marketplace.

The committee feels that, if ANS Forth prescribes stringent requirements upon the virtual machine model,  as did the previous standards, then many implementors will chose not to comply with ANS Forth. The  committee hopes that ANS Forth will serve to unify rather than to further divide the Forth community, and  thus has chosen to encompass rather than invalidate popular implementation techniques.

Many of the changes from Forth 83 are justified by this rationale. Most fall into the category that "an ANS  Forth Standard Program may not assume x", where "x" is an entitlement resulting from the virtual machine  model prescribed by the Forth-83 Standard. The committee feels that these restrictions are reasonable,  especially considering that a substantial number of existing Forth implementations do not correctly  implement the Forth-83 virtual model, thus the Forth-83 entitlements exist "in theory" but not "in practice".

Another way of looking at this is that while ANS Forth acknowledges the diversity of current Forth practice,  it attempts to document the similarity therein. In some sense, ANS Forth is thus a "description of reality"  rather than a "prescription for a particular virtual machine".

Since there is no previous American National Standard for Forth, the action requirements prescribed by  section 3.4 of X3/SD-9, "Policy and Guidelines", regarding previous standards do not apply.

The following discussion describes differences between ANS Forth and Forth 83. In most cases, Forth 83 is  representative of Forth 79 and FIG Forth for the purposes of this discussion. In many of these cases,  however, ANS Forth is more representative of the existing state of the Forth industry than the previously-published standards.

## D.6 Differences from Forth 83 

### D.6.1 Stack width 

Forth 83 specifies that stack items occupy 16 bits. This includes addresses, flags, and numbers. ANS Forth  specifies that stack items are at least 16 bits; the actual size must be documented by the implementation.

<desc>
||Words affected:||
all arithmetic, logical and addressing operators  

||Reason:||
32-bit machines are becoming commonplace. A 16-bit Forth system on a 32-bit  machine is not competitive.

||Impact:||
Programs that assume 16-bit stack width will continue to run on 16-bit machines;  ANS Forth does not require a different stack width, but simply allows it. Many programs will be unaffected  (but see "address unit").

||Transition/Conversion:||
Programs which use bit masks with the high bits set may have to be changed,  substituting either an implementation-defined bit-mask constant, or a procedure to calculate a bit mask in a  stack-width-independent way. Here are some procedures for constructing width-independent bit masks:  

</desc>

    1 CONSTANT LO-BIT 
    TRUE 1 RSHIFT INVERT CONSTANT HI-BIT  
    : LO-BITS ( n -- mask ) 0 SWAP 0 ?DO 1 LSHIFT LO-BIT OR LOOP ; 
    : HI-BITS ( n -- mask ) 0 SWAP 0 ?DO 1 RSHIFT HI-BIT OR LOOP ; 

Programs that depend upon the "modulo 65536" behavior implicit in 16-bit arithmetic operations will need  to be rewritten to explicitly perform the modulus operation in the appropriate places. The committee  believes that such assumptions occur infrequently. Examples: some checksum or CRC calculations, some  random number generators and most fixed-point fractional math.

### D.6.2 Number representation 

Forth 83 specifies two’s-complement number representation and arithmetic. ANS Forth also allows one’s-complement and signed-magnitude.

<desc>
||Words affected:||
all arithmetic and logical operators, LOOP, +LOOP

||Reason:||
Some computers use one’s-complement or signed-magnitude. The committee  did not wish to force Forth implementations for those machines to emulate two’s-complement arithmetic,  and thus incur severe performance penalties. The experience of some committee members with such  machines indicates that the usage restrictions necessary to support their number representations are not  overly burdensome.

||Impact:||
An ANS Forth Standard Program may declare an "environmental dependency on  two’s-complement arithmetic". This means that the otherwise-Standard Program is only guaranteed to work  on two’s-complement machines. Effectively, this is not a severe restriction, because the overwhelming  majority of current computers use two’s-complement. The committee knows of no Forth-83 compliant  implementations for non-two’s-complement machines at present, so existing Forth-83 programs will still  work on the same class of machines on which they currently work.

||Transition/Conversion:||
Existing programs wishing to take advantage of the possibility of ANS Forth  Standard Systems on non-two’s-complement machines may do so by eliminating the use of arithmetic  operators to perform logical functions, by deriving bit-mask constants from bit operations as described in  the section about stack width, by restricting the usage range of unsigned numbers to the range of positive  numbers, and by using the provided operators for conversion from single numbers to double numbers.

</desc>

### D.6.3 Address units 

Forth 83 specifies that each unique address refers to an 8-bit byte in memory. ANS Forth specifies that the  size of the item referred to by each unique address is implementation-defined, but, by default, is the size of  one character. Forth 83 describes many memory operations in terms of a number of bytes. ANS Forth  describes those operations in terms of a number of either characters or address units.

<miniterm>

||Words affected:||those with "address unit" arguments  

||Reason:||
Some machines, including the most popular Forth chip, address 16-bit memory  locations instead of 8-bit bytes.

||Impact:||
Programs may choose to declare an environmental dependency on byte  addressing, and will continue to work on the class of machines for which they now work. In order for a  Forth implementation on a word-addressed machine to be Forth 83 compliant, it would have to simulate  byte addressing at considerable cost in speed and memory efficiency. The committee knows of no such  Forth-83 implementations for such machines, thus an environmental dependency on byte addressing does  not restrict a Standard Program beyond its current de facto restrictions.

||Transition/Conversion:||
The new CHARS and CHAR+ address arithmetic operators should be used for  programs that require portability to non-byte-addressed machines. The places where such conversion is  necessary may be identified by searching for occurrences of words that accept a number of address units as  an argument (e.g., MOVE , ALLOT).

</miniterm>

### D.6.4 Address increment for a cell is no longer two 

As a consequence of Forth-83’s simultaneous specification of 16-bit stack width and byte addressing, the  number two could reliably be used in address calculations involving memory arrays containing items from  the stack. Since ANS Forth requires neither 16-bit stack width nor byte addressing, the number two is no  longer necessarily appropriate for such calculations.

<miniterm>
||Words affected:||
@ ! +! 2+ 2* 2- +LOOP 

||Reason:||
See reasons for "Address Units" and "Stack Width"  

||Impact:||
In this respect, existing programs will continue to work on machines where a  stack cell occupies two address units when stored in memory. This includes most machines for which  Forth 83 compliant implementations currently exist. In principle, it would also include 16-bit-word-addressed machines with 32-bit stack width, but the committee knows of no examples of such machines.

||Transition/Conversion:||The new CELLS and CELL+ address arithmetic operators should be used for  portable programs. The places where such conversion is necessary may be identified by searching for the  character "2" and determining whether or not it is used as part of an address calculation. The following  substitutions are appropriate within address calculations:  

</miniterm>

 |Old<br><div style="width: 10em;"></div>|New<br><div style="width: 10em;"></div>| 
 |--|--|
 |2+ or 2 +|CELL+ 
 |2* or 2 *|CELLS 
 |2- or 2 -|1 CELLS - 
 |2/ or 2 /|1 CELLS / 
 |2|1 CELLS 

The number "2" by itself is sometimes used for address calculations as an argument to +LOOP, when the  loop index is an address. When converting the word 2/ which operates on negative dividends, one should  be cognizant of the rounding method used.

### D.6.5 Address alignment 

Forth 83 imposes no restriction upon the alignment of addresses to any boundary. ANS Forth specifies that  a Standard System may require alignment of addresses for use with various "@" and "!" operators.

<desc>
||Words Affected:||
<code>! +! 2! 2@ @ ? ,</code> 

||Reason:||
Many computers have hardware restrictions that favor the use of aligned  addresses. On some machines, the native memory-access instructions will cause an exception trap if used  with an unaligned address. Even on machines where unaligned accesses do not cause exception traps,  aligned accesses are usually faster.

||Impact:||
All of the ANS Forth words that return addresses suitable for use with aligned "@" and "!" words must return aligned addresses. In most cases, there will be no problem. Problems can arise from the use of user-defined data structures containing a mixture of character data and cell-sized data.

Many existing Forth systems, especially those currently in use on computers with strong alignment  requirements, already require alignment. Much existing Forth code that is currently in use on such  machines has already been converted for use in an aligned environment.

||Transition/Conversion:||
There are two possible approaches to conversion of programs for use on a system  requiring address alignment.

</desc>

The easiest approach is to redefine the system’s aligned "@" and "!" operators so that they do not require  alignment. For example, on a 16-bit little-endian byte-addressed machine, unaligned "@" and "!" could be  defined:  

    : @ ( addr -- x ) DUP C@ SWAP CHAR+ C@ 8 LSHIFT OR ; 
    : ! ( x addr -- ) OVER 8 RSHIFT OVER CHAR+ C! C! ; 

These definitions, and similar ones for "+!", "2@", "2!", ",", and "?" as needed, can be compiled before  an unaligned application, which will then work as expected.

This approach may conserve memory if the application uses substantial numbers of data structures  containing unaligned fields.

Another approach is to modify the application’s source code to eliminate unaligned data fields. The ANS  Forth words ALIGN and ALIGNED may be used to force alignment of data fields. The places where such  alignment is needed may be determined by inspecting the parts of the application where data structures  (other than simple variables) are defined, or by "smart compiler" techniques (see the "Smart Compiler" discussion below).

This approach will probably result in faster application execution speed, at the possible expense of  increased memory utilization for data structures.

Finally, it is possible to combine the preceding techniques by identifying exactly those data fields that are  unaligned, and using "unaligned" versions of the memory access operators for only those fields. This  "hybrid" approach affects a compromise between execution speed and memory utilization.

### D.6.6 Division/modulus rounding direction 

Forth 79 specifies that division rounds toward 0 and the remainder carries the sign of the dividend. Forth 83  specifies that division rounds toward negative infinity and the remainder carries the sign of the divisor.

ANS Forth allows either behavior for the division operators listed below, at the discretion of the  implementor, and provides a pair of division primitives to allow the user to synthesize either explicit  behavior.

<desc>
||Words Affected:||
`/ MOD /MOD */MOD */`

||Reason:||The difference between the division behaviors in Forth 79 and Forth 83 was a  point of much contention, and many Forth implementations did not switch to the Forth 83 behavior. Both  variants have vocal proponents, citing both application requirements and execution efficiency arguments on  both sides. After extensive debate spanning many meetings, the committee was unable to reach a consensus  for choosing one behavior over the other, and chose to allow either behavior as the default, while providing  a means for the user to explicitly use both behaviors as needed. Since implementors are allowed to choose  either behavior, they are not required to change the behavior exhibited by their current systems, thus  preserving correct functioning of existing programs that run on those systems and depend on a particular  behavior. New implementations could choose to supply the behavior that is supported by the native CPU  instruction set, thus maximizing execution speed, or could choose the behavior that is most appropriate for  the intended application domain of the system.

||Impact:||
The issue only affects programs that use a negative dividend with a positive  divisor, or a positive dividend with a negative divisor. The vast majority of uses of division occur with both  a positive dividend and a positive divisor; in that case, the results are the same for both allowed division  behaviors.

||Transition/Conversion:||
For programs that require a specific rounding behavior with division operands of  mixed sign, the division operators used by the program may be redefined in terms of one of the new ANS  Forth division primitives SM/REM (symmetrical division, i.e., round toward zero) or FM/MOD (floored  division, i.e., round toward negative infinity). Then the program may be recompiled without change. For  example, the Forth 83 style division operators may be defined by:  

    : /MOD ( n1 n2 -- n3 n4 ) >R S>D R> FM/MOD ; 
    : MOD ( n1 n2 -- n3 ) /MOD DROP ; 
    : / ( n1 n2 -- n3 ) /MOD SWAP DROP ; 
    : */MOD ( n1 n2 n3 -- n4 n5 ) >R M* R> FM/MOD ; 
    : */ ( n1 n2 n3 -- n4 n5 ) */MOD SWAP DROP ; 

</desc>

### D.6.7 Immediacy 

Forth 83 specified that a number of "compiling words" are "immediate", meaning that they are executed  instead of compiled during compilation. ANS Forth is less specific about most of these words, stating that  their behavior is only defined during compilation, and specifying their results rather than their specific  compile-time actions.

To force the compilation of a word that would normally be executed, Forth 83 provided the words  COMPILE , used with non-immediate words, and [COMPILE] , used with immediate words. ANS Forth  provides the single word POSTPONE , which is used with both immediate and non-immediate words,  automatically selecting the appropriate behavior.

<desc>
||Words Affected:||
`COMPILE [COMPILE] ['] '`

||Reason:||
The designation of particular words as either immediate or not depends upon the  implementation technique chosen for the Forth system. With traditional "threaded code" implementations,  the choice was generally quite clear (with the single exception of the word LEAVE), and the standard could  specify which words should be immediate. However, some of the currently popular implementation  techniques, such as native-code generation with optimization, require the immediacy attribute on a different  set of words than the set of immediate words of a threaded code implementation. ANS Forth,  acknowledging the validity of these other implementation techniques, specifies the immediacy attribute in as  few cases as possible.

When the membership of the set of immediate words is unclear, the decision about whether to use  COMPILE or [COMPILE] becomes unclear. Consequently, ANS Forth provides a "general purpose"  replacement word POSTPONE that serves the purpose of the vast majority of uses of both COMPILE and  [COMPILE], without requiring that the user know whether or not the "postponed" word is immediate.

Similarly, the use of ' and ['] with compiling words is unclear if the precise compilation behavior of those  words is not specified, so ANS Forth does not permit a Standard Program to use ' or ['] with compiling  words.

The traditional (non-immediate) definition of the word COMPILE has an additional problem. Its traditional  definition assumes a threaded code implementation technique, and its behavior can only be properly  described in that context. In the context of ANS Forth, which permits other implementation techniques in  addition to threaded code, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to describe the behavior of the traditional  COMPILE. Rather than changing its behavior, and thus breaking existing code, ANS Forth does not include  the word COMPILE. This allows existing implementations to continue to supply the word COMPILE with  its traditional behavior, if that is appropriate for the implementation.

Impact: [COMPILE] remains in ANS Forth, since its proper use does not depend on  knowledge of whether or not a word is immediate (Use of [COMPILE] with a non-immediate word is and  has always been a no-op). Whether or not you need to use [COMPILE] requires knowledge of whether or  not its target word is immediate, but it is always safe to use [COMPILE]. [COMPILE] is no longer in the  (required) core word set, having been moved to the Core Extensions word set, but the committee anticipates that most vendors will supply it anyway.

In nearly all cases, it is correct to replace both [COMPILE] and COMPILE with POSTPONE. Uses of  [COMPILE] and COMPILE that are not suitable for "mindless" replacement by POSTPONE are quite infrequent, and fall into the following two categories:  

a) Use of [COMPILE] with non-immediate words. This is sometimes done with the words ' (tick, which  was immediate in Forth 79 but not in Forth 83) and LEAVE (which was immediate in Forth 83 but not  in Forth 79), in order to force the compilation of those words without regard to whether you are using a  Forth 79 or Forth 83 system.

b) Use of the phrase COMPILE [COMPILE] &lt;immediate word> to "doubly postpone" an  immediate word.

||Transition/Conversion:||
Many ANS Forth implementations will continue to implement both [COMPILE] and COMPILE in forms compatible with existing usage. In those environments, no conversion is necessary.

For complete portability, uses of COMPILE and [COMPILE] should be changed to POSTPONE , except in  the rare cases indicated above. Uses of [COMPILE] with non-immediate words may be left as-is, and the  program may declare a requirement for the word [COMPILE] from the Core Extensions word set, or the  [COMPILE] before the non-immediate word may be simply deleted if the target word is known to be non-immediate.

Uses of the phrase COMPILE [COMPILE] &lt;immediate-word> may be handled by introducing an "intermediate word" (XX in the example below) and then postponing that word. For example: 

    : ABC COMPILE [COMPILE] IF ; 

changes to:  

    : XX POSTPONE IF ; 
    : ABC POSTPONE XX ; 

A non-standard case can occur with programs that "switch out of compilation state" to explicitly compile a  thread in the dictionary following a COMPILE . For example:  

    : XYZ COMPILE [ ' ABC , ] ; 

This depends heavily on knowledge of exactly how COMPILE and the threaded-code implementation  works. Cases like this cannot be handled mechanically; they must be translated by understanding exactly  what the code is doing, and rewriting that section according to ANS Forth restrictions.

Use the phrase POSTPONE [COMPILE] to replace [COMPILE] [COMPILE].

</desc>

### D.6.8 Input character set 

Forth 83 specifies that the full 7-bit ASCII character set is available through KEY . ANS Forth restricts it to  the graphic characters of the ASCII set, with codes from hex 20 to hex 7E inclusive.

<desc>

||Words Affected:||
KEY

||Reason:||
Many system environments "consume" certain control characters for such  purposes as input editing, job control, or flow control. A Forth implementation cannot always control this  system behavior.

||Impact:||
Standard Programs which require the ability to receive particular control  characters through KEY must declare an environmental dependency on the input character set.

||Transition/Conversion:||
For maximum portability, programs should restrict their required input character  set to only the graphic characters. Control characters may be handled if available, but complete program  functionality should be accessible using only graphic characters.

As stated above, an environmental dependency on the input character set may be declared. Even so, it is  recommended that the program should avoid the requirement for particularly-troublesome control  characters, such as control-S and control-Q (often used for flow control, sometimes by communication  hardware whose presence may be difficult to detect), ASCII NUL (difficult to type on many keyboards), and  the distinction between carriage return and line feed (some systems translate carriage returns into line feeds,  or vice versa).

</desc>

### D.6.9 Shifting with UM/MOD 

Given Forth-83’s two’s-complement nature, and its requirement for floored (round toward minus infinity)  division, shifting is equivalent to division. Also, two’s-complement representation implies that unsigned  division by a power of two is equivalent to logical right-shifting, so UM/MOD could be used to perform a  logical right-shift.

<desc>

||Words Affected:||
UM/MOD

||Reason:||
The problem with UM/MOD is a result of allowing non-two’s-complement  number representations, as already described.

ANS Forth provides the words LSHIFT and RSHIFT to perform logical shifts. This is usually more  efficient, and certainly more descriptive, than the use of UM/MOD for logical shifting.

||Impact:||
Programs running on ANS Forth systems with two’s-complement arithmetic (the  majority of machines), will not experience any incompatibility with UM/MOD . Existing Forth-83 Standard  programs intended to run on non-two’s-complement machines will not be able to use UM/MOD for shifting  on a non-two’s-complement ANS Forth system. This should not affect a significant number of existing  programs (perhaps none at all), since the committee knows of no existing Forth-83 implementations on non-two’s-complement machines.

||Transition/Conversion:||
A program that requires UM/MOD to behave as a shift operation may declare an  environmental dependency on two’s-complement arithmetic.

A program that cannot declare an environmental dependency on two’s-complement arithmetic may require  editing to replace incompatible uses of UM/MOD with other operators defined within the application.

</desc>

### D.6.10 Vocabularies / wordlists 

ANS Forth does not define the words VOCABULARY, CONTEXT, and CURRENT , which were present in  Forth 83. Instead, ANS Forth defines a primitive word set for search order specification and control,  including words which have not existed in any previous standard.

Forth-83’s "ALSO/ONLY" experimental search order word set is specified for the most part as the extension  portion of the ANS Forth Search Order word set.

<desc>

||Words Affected:||
VOCABULARY CONTEXT CURRENT

||Reason:||
Vocabularies are an area of much divergence among existing systems.

Considering major vendors’ systems and previous standards, there are at least 5 different and mutually  incompatible behaviors of words defined by VOCABULARY. Forth 83 took a step in the direction of "run-time search-order specification" by declining to specify a specific relationship between the hierarchy of  compiled vocabularies and the run-time search order. Forth 83 also specified an experimental mechanism  for run-time search-order specification, the ALSO/ONLY scheme. ALSO/ONLY was implemented in  numerous systems, and has achieved some measure of popularity in the Forth community.

However, several vendors refuse to implement it, citing technical limitations. In an effort to address those  limitations and thus hopefully make ALSO/ONLY more palatable to its critics, the committee specified a  simple "primitive word set" that not only fixes some of the objections to ALSO/ONLY, but also provides  sufficient power to implement ALSO/ONLY and all of the other search-order word sets that are currently  popular.

The Forth 83 ALSO/ONLY word set is provided as an optional extension to the search-order word set. This  allows implementors that are so inclined to provide this word set, with well-defined standard behavior, but  does not compel implementors to do so. Some vendors have publicly stated that they will not implement  ALSO/ONLY, no matter what, and one major vendor stated an unwillingness to implement ANS Forth at all  if ALSO/ONLY is mandated. The committee feels that its actions are prudent, specifying ALSO/ONLY to the  extent possible without mandating its inclusion in all systems, and also providing a primitive search-order  word set that vendors may be more likely to implement, and which can be used to synthesize ALSO/ONLY.


||Transition/Conversion:||
Since Forth 83 did not mandate precise semantics for VOCABULARY, existing  Forth-83 Standard programs cannot use it except in a trivial way. Programs can declare a dependency on  the existence of the Search Order word set, and can implement whatever semantics are required using that  word set’s primitives. Forth 83 programs that need ALSO/ONLY can declare a dependency on the Search  Order Extensions word set, or can implement the extensions in terms of the Search Order word set itself.

### D.6.11 Multiprogramming impact 

Forth 83 marked words with "multiprogramming impact" by the letter "M" in the first lines of their  descriptions. ANS Forth has removed the "M" designation from the word descriptions, moving the  discussion of multiprogramming impact to this non-normative annex.

<desc>

||Words affected:||
none

||Reason:||
The meaning of "multiprogramming impact" is precise only in the context of a  specific model for multiprogramming. Although many Forth systems do provide multiprogramming  capabilities using a particular round-robin, cooperative, block-buffer sharing model, that model is not  universal. Even assuming the classical model, the "M" designations did not contain enough information to  enable writing of applications that interacted in a multiprogrammed system.

Practically speaking, the "M" designations in Forth 83 served to document usage rules for block buffer  addresses in multiprogrammed systems. These addresses often become meaningless after a task has  relinquished the CPU for any reason, most often for the purposes of performing I/O, awaiting an event, or  voluntarily sharing CPU resources using the word PAUSE. It was essential that portable applications  respect those usage rules to make it practical to run them on multiprogrammed systems; failure to adhere to  the rules could easily compromise the integrity of other applications running on those systems as well as the  applications actually in error. Thus, "M" appeared on all words that by design gave up the CPU, with the  understanding that other words NEVER gave it up.

These usage rules have been explicitly documented in the Block word set where they are relevant. The "M"  designations have been removed entirely.

||Impact:||
In practice, none.

In the sense that any application that depends on multiprogramming must consist of at least two tasks that  share some resource(s) and communicate between themselves, Forth 83 did not contain enough information  to enable writing of a standard program that DEPENDED on multiprogramming. This is also true of ANS  Forth.

Non-multiprogrammed applications in Forth 83 were required to respect usage rules for BLOCK so that they  could be run properly on multiprogrammed systems. The same is true of ANS Forth.

The only difference is the documentation method used to define the BLOCK usage rules. The Technical  Committee believes that the current method is clearer than the concept of "multiprogramming impact".

||Transition/Conversion:||
none needed.

### D.6.12 Words not provided in executable form 

ANS Forth allows an implementation to supply some words in source code or "load as needed" form, rather  than requiring all supplied words to be available with no additional programmer action.

<desc>

||Words affected:||
all

||Reason:||
Forth systems are often used in environments where memory space is at a  premium. Every word included in the system in executable form consumes memory space. The committee  believes that allowing standard words to be provided in source form will increase the probability that  implementors will provide complete ANS Forth implementations even in systems designed for use in  constrained environments.

||Impact:||
In order to use a Standard Program with a given ANS Forth implementation, it  may be necessary to precede the program with an implementation-dependent "preface" to make "source  form" words executable. This is similar to the methods that other computer languages require for selecting  the library routines needed by a particular application.

In languages like C, the goal of eliminating unnecessary routines from the memory image of an application  is usually accomplished by providing libraries of routines, using a "linker" program to incorporate only the  necessary routines into an executable application. The method of invoking and controlling the linker is  outside the scope of the language definition.

||Transition/Conversion:||
Before compiling a program, the programmer may need to perform some action  to make the words required by that program available for execution.

# E. ANS Forth portability guide (informative annex)  

## E.1 Introduction  

The most popular architectures used to implement Forth have had byte-addressed memory, 16-bit  operations, and two’s-complement number representation. The Forth-83 Standard dictates that these  particular features must be present in a Forth-83 Standard system and that Forth-83 programs may exploit  these features freely.

However, there are many beasts in the architectural jungle that are bit addressed or cell addressed, or prefer  32-bit operations, or represent numbers in one’s complement. Since one of Forth’s strengths is its usefulness in "strange" environments on "unusual" hardware with "peculiar" features, it is important that a  Standard Forth run on these machines too.

A primary goal of the ANS Forth Standard is to increase the types of machines that can support a Standard  Forth. This is accomplished by allowing some key Forth terms to be implementation-defined (e.g., how big  is a cell?) and by providing Forth operators (words) that conceal the implementation. This frees the  implementor to produce the Forth system that most effectively utilizes the native hardware. The machine  independent operators, together with some programmer discipline, enable a programmer to write Forth  programs that work on a wide variety of machines.

The remainder of this Annex provides guidelines for writing portable ANS Forth programs. The first  section describes ways to make a program hardware independent. It is difficult for someone familiar with  only one machine architecture to imagine the problems caused by transporting programs between dissimilar  machines. Consequently, examples of specific architectures with their respective problems are given. The  second section describes assumptions about Forth implementations that many programmers make, but can’t  be relied upon in a portable program.

## E.2 Hardware peculiarities  

### E.2.1 Data/memory abstraction  

Data and memory are the stones and mortar of program construction. Unfortunately, each computer treats  data and memory differently. The ANS Forth Systems Standard gives definitions of data and memory that  apply to a wide variety of computers. These definitions give us a way to talk about the common elements of  data and memory while ignoring the details of specific hardware. Similarly, ANS Forth programs that use  data and memory in ways that conform to these definitions can also ignore hardware details. The following  sections discuss the definitions and describe how to write programs that are independent of the data/memory  peculiarities of different computers.

### E.2.2 Definitions  

Three terms defined by ANS Forth are address unit, cell, and character. The address space of an ANS Forth  system is divided into an array of address units; an address unit is the smallest collection of bits that can be  addressed. In other words, an address unit is the number of bits spanned by the addresses addr and addr+1.

The most prevalent machines use 8-bit address units. Such "byte addressed" machines include the Intel  8086 and Motorola 68000 families. However, other address unit sizes exist. There are machines that are bit addressed and machines that are 4-bit nibble addressed. There are also machines with address units larger  than 8-bits. For example, several Forth-in-hardware computers are cell addressed.

The cell is the fundamental data type of a Forth system. A cell can be a single-cell integer or a memory address. Forth’s parameter and return stacks are stacks of cells. Forth 83 specifies that a cell is 16-bits. In  ANS Forth the size of a cell is an implementation-defined number of address units. Thus, an ANS Forth  implemented on a 16-bit microprocessor could use a 16-bit cell and an implementation on a 32-bit machine  could use a 32-bit cell. Also 18-bit machines, 36-bit machines, etc., could support ANS Forth systems with  18 or 36-bit cells respectively. In all of these systems, DUP does the same thing: it duplicates the top of the data stack. ! (store) behaves consistently too: given two cells on the data stack it stores the second cell in  the memory location designated by the top cell.

Similarly, the definition of a character has been generalized to be an implementation-defined number of  address units (but at least eight bits). This removes the need for a Forth implementor to provide 8-bit  characters on processors where it is inappropriate. For example, on an 18-bit machine with a 9-bit address  unit, a 9-bit character would be most convenient. Since, by definition, you can’t address anything smaller  than an address unit, a character must be at least as big as an address unit. This will result in big characters  on machines with large address units. An example is a 16-bit cell addressed machine where a 16-bit  character makes the most sense.

### E.2.3 Addressing memory  

ANS Forth eliminates many portability problems by using the above definitions. One of the most common  portability problems is addressing successive cells in memory. Given the memory address of a cell, how do  you find the address of the next cell? In Forth 83 this is easy: 2 + . This code assumes that memory is  addressed in 8-bit units (bytes) and a cell is 16-bits wide. On a byte-addressed machine with 32-bit cells the  code to find the next cell would be 4 + . The code would be 1+ on a cell-addressed processor and 16 + on a bit-addressed processor with 16-bit cells. ANS Forth provides a next-cell operator named CELL+ that  can be used in all of these cases. Given an address, CELL+ adjusts the address by the size of a cell  (measured in address units). A related problem is that of addressing an array of cells in an arbitrary order.  A defining word to create an array of cells using Forth 83 would be:  

    : ARRAY CREATE 2* ALLOT DOES> SWAP 2* + ; 

Use of 2* to scale the array index assumes byte addressing and 16-bit cells again. As in the example above,  different versions of the code would be needed for different machines. ANS Forth provides a portable  scaling operator named CELLS. Given a number n, CELLS returns the number of address units needed to  hold n cells. A portable definition of array is:  

    : ARRAY CREATE CELLS ALLOT 
        DOES> SWAP CELLS + ; 

There are also portability problems with addressing arrays of characters. In Forth 83 (and in the most  common ANS Forth implementations), the size of a character will equal the size of an address unit.  Consequently addresses of successive characters in memory can be found using 1+ and scaling indices into  a character array is a no-op (i.e., 1 *). However, there are cases where a character is larger than an address  unit. Examples include (1) systems with small address units (e.g., bit- and nibble-addressed systems), and  (2) systems with large character sets (e.g., 16-bit characters on a byte-addressed machine). CHAR+ and CHARS operators, analogous to CELL+ and CELLS are available to allow maximum portability.

ANS Forth generalizes the definition of some Forth words that operate on chunks of memory to use address  units. One example is ALLOT. By prefixing ALLOT with the appropriate scaling operator (CELLS,  CHARS, etc.), space for any desired data structure can be allocated (see definition of array above). For  example:  

    CREATE ABUFFER 5 CHARS ALLOT ( allot 5 character buffer)  

The memory-block-move word also uses address units:  

    source destination 8 CELLS MOVE ( move 8 cells)  
    
### E.2.4 Alignment problems  

Not all addresses are created equal. Many processors have restrictions on the addresses that can be used by  memory access instructions. This Standard does not require an implementor of an ANS Forth to make  alignment transparent; on the contrary, it requires (in Section **3.3.3.1  Address alignment**) that an ANS  Forth program assume that character and cell alignment may be required.

One of the most common problems caused by alignment restrictions is in creating tables containing both  characters and cells. When , (comma) or C, is used to initialize a table, data is stored at the data-space  pointer. Consequently, it must be suitably aligned. For example, a non-portable table definition would be:  

    CREATE ATABLE 1 C, X , 2 C, Y ,  

On a machine that restricts 16-bit fetches to even addresses, CREATE would leave the data space pointer at  an even address, the 1 C, would make the data space pointer odd, and , (comma) would violate the  address restriction by storing X at an odd address. A portable way to create the table is:  

    CREATE ATABLE 1 C, ALIGN X , 2 C, ALIGN Y ,  

ALIGN adjusts the data space pointer to the first aligned address greater than or equal to its current address.  An aligned address is suitable for storing or fetching characters, cells, cell pairs, or double-cell numbers.

After initializing the table, we would also like to read values from the table. For example, assume we want  to fetch the first cell, X, from the table. ATABLE CHAR+ gives the address of the first thing after the  character. However this may not be the address of X since we aligned the dictionary pointer between the C, and the ,. The portable way to get the address of X is:  

    ATABLE CHAR+ ALIGNED  

ALIGNED adjusts the address on top of the stack to the first aligned address greater than or equal to its  current value.

## E.3 Number representation  

Different computers represent numbers in different ways. An awareness of these differences can help a  programmer avoid writing a program that depends on a particular representation.

### E.3.1 Big endian vs. little endian  

The constituent bits of a number in memory are kept in different orders on different machines. Some  machines place the most-significant part of a number at an address in memory with less-significant parts  following it at higher addresses. Other machines do the opposite — the least-significant part is stored at the  lowest address. For example, the following code for a 16-bit 8086 "little endian" Forth would produce the  answer 34 (hex):  

    VARIABLE FOO HEX 1234 FOO ! FOO C@  

The same code on a 16-bit 68000 "big endian" Forth would produce the answer 12 (hex). A portable  program cannot exploit the representation of a number in memory.

A related issue is the representation of cell pairs and double-cell numbers in memory. When a cell pair is  moved from the stack to memory with 2!, the cell that was on top of the stack is placed at the lower  memory address. It is useful and reasonable to manipulate the individual cells when they are in memory.

### E.3.2 ALU organization  

Different computers use different bit patterns to represent integers. Possibilities include binary  representations (two’s complement, one’s complement, sign magnitude, etc.) and decimal representations  (BCD, etc.). Each of these formats creates advantages and disadvantages in the design of a computer’s arithmetic logic unit (ALU). The most commonly used representation, two’s complement, is popular  because of the simplicity of its addition and subtraction algorithms.

Programmers who have grown up on two’s complement machines tend to become intimate with their  representation of numbers and take some properties of that representation for granted. For example, a trick  to find the remainder of a number divided by a power of two is to mask off some bits with AND. A common  application of this trick is to test a number for oddness using 1 AND. However, this will not work on a  one’s complement machine if the number is negative (a portable technique is 2 MOD).

The remainder of this section is a (non-exhaustive) list of things to watch for when portability between  machines with binary representations other than two’s complement is desired.

To convert a single-cell number to a double-cell number, ANS Forth provides the operator S>D. To  convert a double-cell number to single-cell, Forth programmers have traditionally used DROP. However,  this trick doesn’t work on sign-magnitude machines. For portability a D>S operator is available.  Converting an unsigned single-cell number to a double-cell number can be done portably by pushing a zero  on the stack.

## E.4 Forth system implementation  

During Forth’s history, an amazing variety of implementation techniques have been developed. The ANS  Forth Standard encourages this diversity and consequently restricts the assumptions a user can make about  the underlying implementation of an ANS Forth system. Users of a particular Forth implementation  frequently become accustomed to aspects of the implementation and assume they are common to all Forths.  This section points out many of these incorrect assumptions.

. No method for accessing these fields has been found 

### E.4.1 Definitions  

Traditionally, Forth definitions have consisted of the name of the Forth word, a dictionary search link, data  describing how to execute the definition, and parameters describing the definition itself. These components  are called the name, link, code, and parameter fields3 that works across all of the Forth implementations currently in use. Therefore, ANS Forth severely restricts  how the fields may be used. Specifically, a portable ANS Forth program may not use the name, link, or  code field in any way. Use of the parameter field (renamed to data field for clarity) is limited to the  operations described below.

Only words defined with CREATE or with other defining words that call CREATE have data fields. The  other defining words in the Standard (VARIABLE, CONSTANT, :, etc.) might not be implemented with  CREATE. Consequently, a Standard Program must assume that words defined by VARIABLE, CONSTANT, : , etc., may have no data fields. There is no way for a Standard Program to modify the value of a constant or to change the meaning of a colon definition. The DOES> part of a defining word operates on a data field.  Since only CREATEd words have data fields, DOES> can only be paired with CREATE or words that call  CREATE.

In ANS Forth, FIND, ['] and ' (tick) return an unspecified entity called an "execution token". There are  only a few things that may be done with an execution token. The token may be passed to EXECUTE to  execute the word ticked or compiled into the current definition with COMPILE,. The token can also be  stored in a variable and used later. Finally, if the word ticked was defined via CREATE, >BODY converts  the execution token into the word’s data-field address.

One thing that definitely cannot be done with an execution token is use ! or , to store it into the object code  of a Forth definition. This technique is sometimes used in implementations where the object code is a list of  addresses (threaded code) and an execution token is also an address. However, ANS Forth permits native  code implementations where this will not work.

### E.4.2 Stacks  

In some Forth implementations, it is possible to find the address of a stack in memory and manipulate the  stack as an array of cells. This technique is not portable, however. On some systems, especially Forth-in-hardware systems, the stacks might be in a part of memory that can’t be addressed by the program or might  not be in memory at all. Forth’s parameter and return stacks must be treated as stacks.

> 3 footnote These terms are not defined in the Standard. They are mentioned here for historical continuity.

A Standard Program may use the return stack directly only for temporarily storing values. Every value  examined or removed from the return stack using R@, R>, or 2R> must have been put on the stack explicitly using >R or 2>R. Even this must be done carefully since the system may use the return stack to hold return  addresses and loop-control parameters. Section **3.2.3.3  Return stack** of the Standard has a list of  restrictions.

## E.5 ROMed application disciplines and conventions  

When a Standard System provides a data space which is uniformly readable and writeable we may term this  environment "RAM-only".

Programs designed for ROMed application must divide data space into at least two parts: a writeable and  readable uninitialized part, called "RAM", and a read-only initialized part, called "ROM". A third  possibility, a writeable and readable initialized part, normally called "initialized RAM", is not addressed by  this discipline. A Standard Program must explicitly initialize the RAM data space as needed.

The separation of data space into RAM and ROM is meaningful only during the generation of the ROMed  program. If the ROMed program is itself a standard development system, it has the same taxonomy as an  ordinary RAM-only system.

The words affected by conversion from a RAM-only to a mixed RAM and ROM environment are:  

    , (comma) ALIGN ALIGNED ALLOT C, CREATE HERE UNUSED
    (VARIABLE always accesses the RAM data space.) 

With the exception of , (comma) and C, these words are meaningful in both RAM and ROM data space.

To select the data space, these words could be preceded by selectors RAM and ROM. For example:  

    ROM CREATE ONES 32 ALLOT ONES 32 1 FILL RAM  
    
would create a table of ones in the ROM data space. The storage of data into RAM data space when  generating a program for ROM would be an ambiguous condition.

A straightforward implementation of these selectors would maintain separate address counters for each  space. A counter value would be returned by HERE and altered by , (comma), C,, ALIGN, and ALLOT,  with RAM and ROM simply selecting the appropriate address counter. This technique could be extended to  additional partitions of the data space.

## E.6 Summary  

The ANS Forth Standard cannot and should not force anyone to write a portable program. In situations  where performance is paramount, the programmer is encouraged to use every trick in the book. On the  other hand, if portability to a wide variety of systems is needed, ANS Forth provides the tools to accomplish  this. There is probably no such thing as a completely portable program. A programmer, using this guide,  should intelligently weigh the tradeoffs of providing portability to specific machines. For example,  machines that use sign-magnitude numbers are rare and probably don’t deserve much thought. But, systems  with different cell sizes will certainly be encountered and should be provided for. In general, making a  program portable clarifies both the programmer’s thinking process and the final program.

# F. Alphabetic list of words (informative annex)  

In the following list, the last, four-digit, part of the reference number establishes a sequence corresponding  to the alphabetic ordering of all standard words. The first two or three parts indicate the word set and  glossary section in which the word is defined.
