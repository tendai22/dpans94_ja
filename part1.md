# 1. Introduction 


## 1.1 Purpose 

The purpose of this Standard is to promote the portability of Forth programs for use on a wide variety of  computing systems, to facilitate the communication of programs, programming techniques, and ideas among  Forth programmers, and to serve as a basis for the future evolution of the Forth language. 

## 1.2 Scope 

This Standard specifies an interface between a Forth System and a Forth Program by defining the words  provided by a Standard System. 

### 1.2.1 Inclusions 

This Standard specifies: 
– the forms that a program written in the Forth language may take; 
– the rules for interpreting the meaning of a program and its data. 

### 1.2.2 Exclusions 

This Standard does not specify: 
– the mechanism by which programs are transformed for use on computing systems; 
– the operations required for setup and control of the use of programs on computing systems; 
– the method of transcription of programs or their input or output data to or from a storage medium; 

- the program and Forth system behavior when the rules of this Standard fail to establish an  interpretation; 

- the size or complexity of a program and its data that will exceed the capacity of any specific computing  system or the capability of a particular Forth system; 
– the physical properties of input/output records, files, and units; 
– the physical properties and implementation of storage.

## 1.3 Document organization 


### 1.3.1 Word sets 

This Standard groups Forth words and capabilities into word sets under a name indicating some shared  aspect, typically their common functional area. Each word set may have an extension, containing words that  offer additional functionality. These words are not required in an implementation of the word set. 
The “Core” word set, defined in sections 1 through 6, contains the required words and capabilities of a  Standard System. The other word sets, defined in sections 7 through 17, are optional, making it possible to  provide Standard Systems with tailored levels of functionality. 

#### 1.3.1.1 Text sections 

Within each word set, section 1 contains introductory and explanatory material and section 2 introduces  terms and notation used throughout the Standard. There are no requirements in these sections. 
Sections 3 and 4 contain the usage and documentation requirements, respectively, for Standard Systems and  Programs, while section 5 specifies their labeling. 

#### 1.3.1.2 Glossary sections 

Section 6 of each word set specifies the required behavior of the definitions in the word set and the  extensions word set. 

### 1.3.2 Annexes 

The annexes do not contain any required material. 
Annex A provides some of the rationale behind the committee’s decisions in creating this Standard, as well  as implementation examples. It has the same section numbering as the body of the Standard to make it easy  to relate each requirements section to its rationale section. 
Annex B is a short bibliography on Forth. 
Annex C provides an introduction to Forth. 
Annex D discusses the compatibility of ANS Forth with earlier Forths, emphasizing the differences from  Forth 83. 
Annex E presents some techniques for writing portable programs in ANS Forth. 
Annex F includes the words from all word sets in a single list, and serves as an index of ANS Forth words. 

## 1.4 Future directions 


### 1.4.1 New technology 

This Standard adopts certain words and practices that are increasingly found in common practice. New  words have also been adopted to ease creation of portable programs. 

### 1.4.2 Obsolescent features 

This Standard adopts certain words and practices that cause some previously used words to become  obsolescent. Although retained here because of their widespread use, their use in new implementations or  new programs is discouraged, because they may be withdrawn from future revisions of the Standard. 
This Standard designates the following words as obsolescent: 
 6.2.0060 #TIB 15.6.2.1580 FORGET 6.2.2240 SPAN   6.2.0970 CONVERT 6.2.2040 QUERY 6.2.2290 TIB  6.2.1390 EXPECT

# 2. Terms, notation, and references 

The phrase “See:” is used throughout this Standard to direct the reader to other sections of the Standard that  have a direct bearing on the current section. 
In this Standard, “shall” states a requirement on a system or program; conversely, “shall not” is a  prohibition; “need not” means “is not required to”; “should” describes a recommendation of the Standard; 
and “may”, depending on context, means “is allowed to” or “might happen”. 
Throughout the Standard, typefaces are used in the following manner: 

- This proportional serif typeface is used for text, with italic used for symbols and the first appearance of  new terms; 
– A bold proportional sans-serif typeface is used for headings; 
– A bold monospaced serif typeface is used for Forth-language text. 

## 2.1 Definitions of terms 

Terms defined in this section are used generally throughout this Standard. Additional terms specific to  individual word sets are defined in those word sets. Other terms are defined at their first appearance,  indicated by italic type. Terms not defined in this Standard are to be construed according to the Dictionary for Information Systems, ANSI X3.172-1990. 
address unit: Depending on context, either 1) the units into which a Forth address space is divided for the  purposes of locating data objects such as characters and variables; 2) the physical memory storage elements  corresponding to those units; 3) the contents of such a memory storage element; or 4) the units in which the  length of a region of memory is expressed. 
aligned address: The address of a memory location at which a character, cell, cell pair, or double-cell  integer can be accessed. 
ambiguous condition: A circumstance for which this Standard does not prescribe a specific behavior for  Forth systems and programs. 
Ambiguous conditions include such things as the absence of a needed delimiter while parsing, attempted  access to a nonexistent file, or attempted use of a nonexistent word. An ambiguous condition also exists  when a Standard word is passed values that are improper or out of range. 
cell: The primary unit of information in the architecture of a Forth system. 
cell pair: Two cells that are treated as a single unit. 
character: Depending on context, either 1) a storage unit capable of holding a character; or 2) a member of  a character set. 
character-aligned address: The address of a memory location at which a character can be accessed. 
character string: Data space that is associated with a sequence of consecutive character-aligned addresses. 
Character strings usually contain text. Unless otherwise indicated, the term “string” means “character  string”. 
code space: The logical area of the dictionary in which word semantics are implemented. 
compile: To transform source code into dictionary definitions. 
compilation semantics: The behavior of a Forth definition when its name is encountered by the text  interpreter in compilation state. 
counted string: A data structure consisting of one character containing a length followed by zero or more  contiguous data characters. Normally, counted strings contain text. 

TRAILER ANSI X3.215-1994 4
cross compiler: A system that compiles a program for later execution in an environment that may be  physically and logically different from the compiling environment. In a cross compiler, the term “host”  applies to the compiling environment, and the term “target” applies to the run-time environment. 
current definition: The definition whose compilation has been started but not yet ended. 
data field: The data space associated with a word defined via CREATE. 
data space: The logical area of the dictionary that can be accessed. 
data-space pointer: The address of the next available data space location, i.e., the value returned by  HERE. 
data stack: A stack that may be used for passing parameters between definitions. When there is no  possibility of confusion, the data stack is referred to as “the stack”. Contrast with return stack. 
data type: An identifier for the set of values that a data object may have. 
defining word: A Forth word that creates a new definition when executed. 
definition: A Forth execution procedure compiled into the dictionary. 
dictionary: An extensible structure that contains definitions and associated data space. 
display: To send one or more characters to the user output device. 
environmental dependencies: A program’s implicit assumptions about a Forth system’s implementation  options or underlying hardware. For example, a program that assumes a cell size greater than 16 bits is said  to have an environmental dependency. 
execution semantics: The behavior of a Forth definition when it is executed. 
execution token: A value that identifies the execution semantics of a definition. 
find: To search the dictionary for a definition name matching a given string. 
immediate word: A Forth word whose compilation semantics are to perform its execution semantics. 
implementation defined: Denotes system behaviors or features that must be provided and documented by  a system but whose further details are not prescribed by this Standard. 
implementation dependent: Denotes system behaviors or features that must be provided by a system but  whose further details are not prescribed by this Standard. 
input buffer: A region of memory containing the sequence of characters from the input source that is  currently accessible to a program. 
input source: The device, file, block, or other entity that supplies characters to refill the input buffer. 
input source specification: A set of information describing a particular state of the input source, input  buffer, and parse area. This information is sufficient, when saved and restored properly, to enable the  nesting of parsing operations on the same or different input sources. 
interpretation semantics: The behavior of a Forth definition when its name is encountered by the text  interpreter in interpretation state. 
keyboard event: A value received by the system denoting a user action at the user input device. The term  “keyboard” in this document does not exclude other types of user input devices. 
line: A sequence of characters followed by an actual or implied line terminator. 
name space: The logical area of the dictionary in which definition names are stored. 
number: In this Standard, “number” used without other qualification means “integer”. Similarly, “double  number” means “double-cell integer”. 

TRAILER  ANSI X3.215-1994  5
parse: To select and exclude a character string from the parse area using a specified set of delimiting  characters, called delimiters. 
parse area: The portion of the input buffer that has not yet been parsed, and is thus available to the system  for subsequent processing by the text interpreter and other parsing operations. 
pictured-numeric output: A number display format in which the number is converted using Forth words  that resemble a symbolic “picture” of the desired output. 
program: A complete specification of execution to achieve a specific function (application task) expressed  in Forth source code form. 
receive: To obtain characters from the user input device. 
return stack: A stack that may be used for program execution nesting, do-loop execution, temporary  storage, and other purposes. 
standard word: A named Forth procedure, formally specified in this Standard. 
user input device: The input device currently selected as the source of received data, typically a keyboard. 
user output device: The output device currently selected as the destination of display data. 
variable: A named region of data space located and accessed by its memory address. 
word: Depending on context, either 1) the name of a Forth definition; or 2) a parsed sequence of non-space  characters, which could be the name of a Forth definition. 
word list: A list of associated Forth definition names that may be examined during a dictionary search. 
word set: A set of Forth definitions grouped together in this Standard under a name indicating some shared  aspect, typically their common functional area. 

## 2.2 Notation 


### 2.2.1 Numeric notation 

Unless otherwise stated, all references to numbers apply to signed single-cell integers. The inclusive range  of values is shown as {from...to}. The allowable range for the contents of an address is shown in double  braces, particularly for the contents of variables, e.g., BASE {{2...36}}. 

### 2.2.2 Stack notation 

Stack parameters input to and output from a definition are described using the notation: 
( stack-id before -- after ) where stack-id specifies which stack is being described, before represents the stack-parameter data types  before execution of the definition and after represents them after execution. The symbols used in before and after are shown in table 3.1. 
The control-flow-stack stack-id is “C:”, the data-stack stack-id is “S:”, and the return-stack stack-id is “R:”. 
When there is no confusion, the data-stack stack-id may be omitted. 
When there are alternate after representations, they are described by “after1 | after2”. The top of the stack is  to the right. Only those stack items required for or provided by execution of the definition are shown. 

### 2.2.3 Parsed-text notation 

If, in addition to using stack parameters, a definition parses text, that text is specified by an abbreviation  from table 2.1, shown surrounded by double-quotes and placed between the before parameters and the “--”  separator in the first stack described, e.g.,  ( S: before “parsed-text-abbreviation” -- after ).

### 2.2.4 Glossary notation 

The glossary entries for each word set are listed in the standard ASCII collating sequence. Each glossary  entry specifies an ANS Forth word and consists of two parts: an index line and the semantic description of  the definition. 

#### 2.2.4.1 Glossary index line 

The index line is a single-line entry containing, from left to right: 

- Section number, the last four digits of which assign a unique sequential number to all words included in  this Standard; 
– DEFINITION-NAME in upper-case, mono-spaced, bold-face letters; 
– Natural-language pronunciation in quotes if it differs from English; 
– Word-set designator from table 2.2. The designation for extensions word sets includes “EXT”.

# 3. Usage requirements 

A system shall provide all of the words defined in 6.1 Core Words. It may also provide any words defined  in the optional word sets and extensions word sets. No standard word provided by a system shall alter the  system state in a way that changes the effect of execution of any other standard word except as provided in  this Standard. A system may contain non-standard extensions, provided that they are consistent with the  requirements of this Standard. 
The implementation of a system may use words and techniques outside the scope of this Standard. 
A system need not provide all words in executable form. The implementation may provide definitions,  including definitions of words in the Core word set, in source form only. If so, the mechanism for adding  the definitions to the dictionary is implementation defined. 
A program that requires a system to provide words or techniques not defined in this Standard has an  environmental dependency. 

## 3.1 Data types 

A data type identifies the set of permissible values for a data object. It is not a property of a particular  storage location or position on a stack. Moving a data object shall not affect its type. 
No data-type checking is required of a system. An ambiguous condition exists if an incorrectly typed data  object is encountered. 
Table 3.1 summarizes the data types used throughout this Standard. Multiple instances of the same type in  the description of a definition are suffixed with a sequence digit subscript to distinguish them. 

### 3.1.1 Data-type relationships 

Some of the data types are subtypes of other data types. A data type i is a subtype of type j if and only if the  members of i are a subset of the members of j. The following list represents the subtype relationships using  the phrase “i => j” to denote “i is a subtype of j”. The subtype relationship is transitive; if i => j and j => k then i => k: 
+n => u => x; 
+n => n => x; 
char => +n; 
a-addr => c-addr => addr => u; 
flag => x; 
xt => x; 
+d => d => xd; 
+d => ud => xd. 
Any Forth definition that accepts an argument of type i shall also accept an argument that is a subtype of i. 

### 3.1.2 Character types 

Characters shall be at least one address unit wide, contain at least eight bits, and have a size less than or  equal to cell size. 
The characters provided by a system shall include the graphic characters {32..126}, which represent graphic  forms as shown in table 3.2. 

#### 3.1.2.1 Graphic characters 

A graphic character is one that is normally displayed (e.g., A, #, &, 6). These values and graphics, shown in  table 3.2, are taken directly from ANS X3.4-1974 (ASCII) and ISO 646-1983, International Reference  Version (IRV). The graphic forms of characters outside the hex range {20..7E} are implementationdefined. Programs that use the graphic hex 24 (the currency sign) have an environmental dependency. 

TRAILER  ANSI X3.215-1994  9
The graphic representation of characters is not restricted to particular type fonts or styles. The graphics  here are examples. 

#### 3.1.2.2 Control characters 

All non-graphic characters included in the implementation-defined character set are defined in this Standard  as control characters. In particular, the characters {0..31}, which could be included in the implementationdefined character set, are control characters. 
Programs that require the ability to send or receive control characters have an environmental dependency.

### 3.1.3 Single-cell types 

The implementation-defined fixed size of a cell is specified in address units and the corresponding number  of bits. See E.2 Hardware peculiarities. 
Cells shall be at least one address unit wide and contain at least sixteen bits. The size of a cell shall be an  integral multiple of the size of a character. Data-stack elements, return-stack elements, addresses, execution  tokens, flags, and integers are one cell wide. 

#### 3.1.3.1 Flags 

Flags may have one of two logical states, true or false. Programs that use flags as arithmetic operands have  an environmental dependency. 
A true flag returned by a standard word shall be a single-cell value with all bits set. A false flag returned by  a standard word shall be a single-cell value with all bits clear. 

#### 3.1.3.2 Integers 

The implementation-defined range of signed integers shall include {-32767..+32767}. 
The implementation-defined range of non-negative integers shall include {0..32767}. 
The implementation-defined range of unsigned integers shall include {0..65535}. 

#### 3.1.3.3 Addresses 

An address identifies a location in data space with a size of one address unit, which a program may fetch  from or store into except for the restrictions established in this Standard. The size of an address unit is  specified in bits. Each distinct address value identifies exactly one such storage element. See 3.3.3 Data  space. 
The set of character-aligned addresses, addresses at which a character can be accessed, is an  implementation-defined subset of all addresses. Adding the size of a character to a character-aligned  address shall produce another character-aligned address. 
The set of aligned addresses is an implementation-defined subset of character-aligned addresses. Adding  the size of a cell to an aligned address shall produce another aligned address. 

#### 3.1.3.4 Counted strings 

A counted string in memory is identified by the address (c-addr) of its length character. 

TRAILER  ANSI X3.215-1994  11
The length character of a counted string shall contain a binary representation of the number of data  characters, between zero and the implementation-defined maximum length for a counted string. The  maximum length of a counted string shall be at least 255. 

#### 3.1.3.5 Execution tokens 

Different definitions may have the same execution token if the definitions are equivalent. 

### 3.1.4 Cell-pair types 

A cell pair in memory consists of a sequence of two contiguous cells. The cell at the lower address is the  first cell, and its address is used to identify the cell pair. Unless otherwise specified, a cell pair on a stack  consists of the first cell immediately above the second cell. 

#### 3.1.4.1 Double-cell integers 

On the stack, the cell containing the most significant part of a double-cell integer shall be above the cell  containing the least significant part. 
The implementation-defined range of double-cell signed integers shall include  {-2147483647..+2147483647}. 
The implementation-defined range of double-cell non-negative integers shall include {0..2147483647}. 
The implementation-defined range of double-cell unsigned integers shall include {0..4294967295}. Placing  the single-cell integer zero on the stack above a single-cell unsigned integer produces a double-cell unsigned  integer with the same value. See 3.2.1.1 Internal number representation. 

#### 3.1.4.2 Character strings 

A string is specified by a cell pair (c-addr u) representing its starting address and length in characters. 

### 3.1.5 System types 

The system data types specify permitted word combinations during compilation and execution. 

#### 3.1.5.1 System-compilation types 

These data types denote zero or more items on the control-flow stack (see 3.2.3.2). The possible presence  of such items on the data stack means that any items already there shall be unavailable to a program until the  control-flow-stack items are consumed. 
The implementation-dependent data generated upon beginning to compile a definition and consumed at its  close is represented by the symbol colon-sys throughout this Standard. 
The implementation-dependent data generated upon beginning to compile a do-loop structure such as  DO ... LOOP and consumed at its close is represented by the symbol do-sys throughout this Standard. 
The implementation-dependent data generated upon beginning to compile a CASE ... ENDCASE structure and consumed at its close is represented by the symbol case-sys throughout this Standard. 
The implementation-dependent data generated upon beginning to compile an OF ... ENDOF structure  and consumed at its close is represented by the symbol of-sys throughout this Standard. 
The implementation-dependent data generated and consumed by executing the other standard control-flow  words is represented by the symbols orig and dest throughout this Standard. 

#### 3.1.5.2 System-execution types 

These data types denote zero or more items on the return stack. Their possible presence means that any  items already on the return stack shall be unavailable to a program until the system-execution items are  consumed. 
The implementation-dependent data generated upon beginning to execute a definition and consumed upon  exiting it is represented by the symbol nest-sys throughout this Standard. 

TRAILER ANSI X3.215-1994 12
The implementation-dependent loop-control parameters used to control the execution of do-loops are  represented by the symbol loop-sys throughout this Standard. Loop-control parameters shall be available  inside the do-loop for words that use or change these parameters, words such as I, J, LEAVE and UNLOOP. 

## 3.2 The implementation environment 


### 3.2.1 Numbers 


#### 3.2.1.1 Internal number representation 

This Standard allows one’s complement, two’s complement, or sign-magnitude number representations and  arithmetic. Arithmetic zero is represented as the value of a single cell with all bits clear. 
The representation of a number as a compiled literal or in memory is implementation dependent. 

#### 3.2.1.2 Digit conversion 

Numbers shall be represented externally by using characters from the standard character set. 
Conversion between the internal and external forms of a digit shall behave as follows: 
The value in BASE is the radix for number conversion. A digit has a value ranging from zero to one less  than the contents of BASE. The digit with the value zero corresponds to the character “0”. This  representation of digits proceeds through the character set to the decimal value nine corresponding to the  character “9”. For digits beginning with the decimal value ten the graphic characters beginning with the  character “A” are used. This correspondence continues up to and including the digit with the decimal value  thirty-five which is represented by the character “Z”. The conversion of digits outside this range is  implementation defined. 

#### 3.2.1.3 Free-field number display 

Free-field number display uses the characters described in digit conversion, without leading zeros, in a field  the exact size of the converted string plus a trailing space. If a number is zero, the least significant digit is  not considered a leading zero. If the number is negative, a leading minus sign is displayed. 
Number display may use the pictured numeric output string buffer to hold partially converted strings (see  #### 3.3.3.6 Other transient regions). 

### 3.2.2 Arithmetic 


#### 3.2.2.1 Integer division 

Division produces a quotient q and a remainder r by dividing operand a by operand b. Division operations  return q, r, or both. The identity b*q + r = a shall hold for all a and b. 
When unsigned integers are divided and the remainder is not zero, q is the largest integer less than the true  quotient. 
When signed integers are divided, the remainder is not zero, and a and b have the same sign, q is the largest  integer less than the true quotient. If only one operand is negative, whether q is rounded toward negative  infinity (floored division) or rounded towards zero (symmetric division) is implementation defined. 
Floored division is integer division in which the remainder carries the sign of the divisor or is zero, and the  quotient is rounded to its arithmetic floor. Symmetric division is integer division in which the remainder  carries the sign of the dividend or is zero and the quotient is the mathematical quotient “rounded towards  zero” or “truncated”. Examples of each are shown in tables 3.3 and 3.4. 
In cases where the operands differ in sign and the rounding direction matters, a program shall either include  code generating the desired form of division, not relying on the implementation-defined default result, or  have an environmental dependency on the desired rounding direction. 

TRAILER  ANSI X3.215-1994  13

#### 3.2.2.2 Other integer operations 

In all integer arithmetic operations, both overflow and underflow shall be ignored. The value returned when  either overflow or underflow occurs is implementation defined. 

### 3.2.3 Stacks 


#### 3.2.3.1 Data stack 

Objects on the data stack shall be one cell wide. 

#### 3.2.3.2 Control-flow stack 

The control-flow stack is a last-in, first out list whose elements define the permissible matchings of controlflow words and the restrictions imposed on data-stack usage during the compilation of control structures. 
The elements of the control-flow stack are system-compilation data types. 
The control-flow stack may, but need not, physically exist in an implementation. If it does exist, it may be,  but need not be, implemented using the data stack. The format of the control-flow stack is implementation  defined. Since the control-flow stack may be implemented using the data stack, items placed on the data  stack are unavailable to a program after items are placed on the control-flow stack and remain unavailable  until the control-flow stack items are removed. 

#### 3.2.3.3 Return stack 

Items on the return stack shall consist of one or more cells. A system may use the return stack in an  implementation-dependent manner during the compilation of definitions, during the execution of do-loops,  and for storing run-time nesting information. 
A program may use the return stack for temporary storage during the execution of a definition subject to the  following restrictions: 

- A program shall not access values on the return stack (using R@, R>, 2R@ or 2R>) that it did not place  there using >R or 2>R; 

- A program shall not access from within a do-loop values placed on the return stack before the loop was  entered; 

- All values placed on the return stack within a do-loop shall be removed before I, J, LOOP, +LOOP,  UNLOOP, or LEAVE is executed; 

- All values placed on the return stack within a definition shall be removed before the definition is  terminated or before EXIT is executed. 

### 3.2.4 Operator terminal 

See 1.2.2 Exclusions. 

#### 3.2.4.1 User input device 

The method of selecting the user input device is implementation defined.

#### 3.2.4.2 User output device 

The method of selecting the user output device is implementation defined. 

### 3.2.5 Mass storage 

A system need not provide any standard words for accessing mass storage. If a system provides any  standard word for accessing mass storage, it shall also implement the Block word set. 

### 3.2.6 Environmental queries 

The name spaces for ENVIRONMENT? and definitions are disjoint. Names of definitions that are the same  as ENVIRONMENT? strings shall not impair the operation of ENVIRONMENT?. Table 3.5 contains the  valid input strings and corresponding returned value for inquiring about the programming environment with  ENVIRONMENT?.

If an environmental query (using ENVIRONMENT?) returns false (i.e., unknown) in response to a string,  subsequent queries using the same string may return true. If a query returns true (i.e., known) in response to  a string, subsequent queries with the same string shall also return true. If a query designated as constant in  the above table returns true and a value in response to a string, subsequent queries with the same string shall  return true and the same value. 

## 3.3 The Forth dictionary 

Forth words are organized into a structure called the dictionary. While the form of this structure is not  specified by the Standard, it can be described as consisting of three logical parts: a name space, a code  space, and a data space. The logical separation of these parts does not require their physical separation. 
A program shall not fetch from or store into locations outside data space. An ambiguous condition exists if  a program addresses name space or code space. 

TRAILER  ANSI X3.215-1994  15

### 3.3.1 Name space 

The relationship between name space and data space is implementation dependent. 

#### 3.3.1.1 Word lists 

The structure of a word list is implementation dependent. When duplicate names exist in a word list, the  latest-defined duplicate shall be the one found during a search for the name. 

#### 3.3.1.2 Definition names 

Definition names shall contain {1..31} characters. A system may allow or prohibit the creation of definition  names containing non-standard characters. 
Programs that use lower case for standard definition names or depend on the case-sensitivity properties of a  system have an environmental dependency. 
A program shall not create definition names containing non-graphic characters. 

### 3.3.2 Code space 

The relationship between code space and data space is implementation dependent. 

### 3.3.3 Data space 

Data space is the only logical area of the dictionary for which standard words are provided to allocate and  access regions of memory. These regions are: contiguous regions, variables, text-literal regions, input  buffers, and other transient regions, each of which is described in the following sections. A program may  read from or write into these regions unless otherwise specified. 

#### 3.3.3.1 Address alignment 

Most addresses used in ANS Forth are aligned addresses (indicated by a-addr) or character-aligned  (indicated by c-addr). ALIGNED, CHAR+, and arithmetic operations can alter the alignment state of an  address on the stack. CHAR+ applied to an aligned address returns a character-aligned address that can only  be used to access characters. Applying CHAR+ to a character-aligned address produces the succeeding  character-aligned address. Adding or subtracting an arbitrary number to an address can produce an  unaligned address that shall not be used to fetch or store anything. The only way to find the next aligned  address is with ALIGNED. An ambiguous condition exists when @, !, , (comma), +!, 2@, or 2! is used  with an address that is not aligned, or when C@, C!, or C, is used with an address that is not characteraligned. 
The definitions of 6.1.1000 CREATE and 6.1.2410 VARIABLE require that the definitions created by them  return aligned addresses. 
After definitions are compiled or the word ALIGN is executed the data-space pointer is guaranteed to be  aligned. 

#### 3.3.3.2 Contiguous regions 

A system guarantees that a region of data space allocated using ALLOT, , (comma), C, (c-comma), and  ALIGN shall be contiguous with the last region allocated with one of the above words, unless the  restrictions in the following paragraphs apply. The data-space pointer HERE always identifies the beginning  of the next data-space region to be allocated. As successive allocations are made, the data-space pointer  increases. A program may perform address arithmetic within contiguously allocated regions. The last  region of data space allocated using the above operators may be released by allocating a corresponding  negatively-sized region using ALLOT, subject to the restrictions of the following paragraphs. 
CREATE establishes the beginning of a contiguous region of data space, whose starting address is returned  by the CREATEd definition. This region is terminated by compiling the next definition. 

TRAILER ANSI X3.215-1994 16
Since an implementation is free to allocate data space for use by code, the above operators need not produce  contiguous regions of data space if definitions are added to or removed from the dictionary between  allocations. An ambiguous condition exists if deallocated memory contains definitions. 

#### 3.3.3.3 Variables 

The region allocated for a variable may be non-contiguous with regions subsequently allocated with  , (comma) or ALLOT. For example, in: 
VARIABLE X 1 CELLS ALLOT  the region X and the region ALLOTted could be non-contiguous. 
Some system-provided variables, such as STATE, are restricted to read-only access. 

#### 3.3.3.4 Text-literal regions 

The text-literal regions, specified by strings compiled with S" and C", may be read-only. 
A program shall not store into the text-literal regions created by S" and C" nor into any read-only system  variable or read-only transient regions. An ambiguous condition exists when a program attempts to store  into read-only regions. 

#### 3.3.3.5 Input buffers 

The address, length, and content of the input buffer may be transient. A program shall not write into the  input buffer. In the absence of any optional word sets providing alternative input sources, the input buffer is  either the terminal-input buffer, used by QUIT to hold one line from the user input device, or a buffer  specified by EVALUATE. In all cases, SOURCE returns the beginning address and length in characters of  the current input buffer. 
The minimum size of the terminal-input buffer shall be 80 characters. 
The address and length returned by SOURCE, the string returned by PARSE, and directly computed inputbuffer addresses are valid only until the text interpreter does I/O to refill the input buffer or the input source  is changed. 
A program may modify the size of the parse area by changing the contents of >IN within the limits imposed  by this Standard. For example, if the contents of >IN are saved before a parsing operation and restored  afterwards, the text that was parsed will be available again for subsequent parsing operations. The extent of  permissible repositioning using this method depends on the input source (see 7.3.3 Block buffer regions and 11.3.4 Input source). 
A program may directly examine the input buffer using its address and length as returned by SOURCE; the  beginning of the parse area within the input buffer is indexed by the number in >IN. The values are valid  for a limited time. An ambiguous condition exists if a program modifies the contents of the input buffer. 

#### 3.3.3.6 Other transient regions 

The data space regions identified by PAD, WORD, and #> (the pictured numeric output string buffer) may be  transient. Their addresses and contents may become invalid after: 
– a definition is created via a defining word; 
– definitions are compiled with : or :NONAME; 
– data space is allocated using ALLOT, , (comma), C, (c-comma), or ALIGN. 
The previous contents of the regions identified by WORD and #> may be invalid after each use of these  words. Further, the regions returned by WORD and #> may overlap in memory. Consequently, use of one of  these words can corrupt a region returned earlier by a different word. The other words that construct  pictured numeric output strings (<#, #, #S, and HOLD) may also modify the contents of these regions. 

TRAILER  ANSI X3.215-1994  17
Words that display numbers may be implemented using pictured numeric output words. Consequently, .
(dot), .R, .S, ?, D., D.R, U., and U.R could also corrupt the regions. 
The size of the scratch area whose address is returned by PAD shall be at least 84 characters. The contents  of the region addressed by PAD are intended to be under the complete control of the user: no words defined  in this Standard place anything in the region, although changing data-space allocations as described in
#### 3.3.3.2 Contiguous regions may change the address returned by PAD. Non-standard words provided by an 

implementation may use PAD, but such use shall be documented. 
The size of the region identified by WORD shall be at least 33 characters. 
The size of the pictured numeric output string buffer shall be at least (2*n) + 2 characters, where n is the  number of bits in a cell. Programs that consider it a fixed area with unchanging access parameters have an  environmental dependency. 

## 3.4 The Forth text interpreter 

Upon start-up, a system shall be able to interpret, as described by 6.1.2050 QUIT, Forth source code  received interactively from a user input device. 
Such interactive systems usually furnish a “prompt” indicating that they have accepted a user request and  acted on it. The implementation-defined Forth prompt should contain the word “OK” in some combination  of upper or lower case. 
Text interpretation (see 6.1.1360 EVALUATE and 6.1.2050 QUIT) shall repeat the following steps until  either the parse area is empty or an ambiguous condition exists: 
a) Skip leading spaces and parse a name (see 3.4.1); 
b) Search the dictionary name space (see 3.4.2). If a definition name matching the string is found: 
1) if interpreting, perform the interpretation semantics of the definition (see 3.4.3.2), and continue at  a); 
2) if compiling, perform the compilation semantics of the definition (see 3.4.3.3), and continue at a). 
c) If a definition name matching the string is not found, attempt to convert the string to a number  (see 3.4.1.3). If successful: 
1) if interpreting, place the number on the data stack, and continue at a); 
2) if compiling, compile code that when executed will place the number on the stack (see 6.1.1780 LITERAL), and continue at a); 
d) If unsuccessful, an ambiguous condition exists (see 3.4.4). 

TRAILER ANSI X3.215-1994 18

### 3.4.1 Parsing 

Unless otherwise noted, the number of characters parsed may be from zero to the implementation-defined  maximum length of a counted string. 
If the parse area is empty, i.e., when the number in >IN is equal to the length of the input buffer, or contains  no characters other than delimiters, the selected string is empty. Otherwise, the selected string begins with  the next character in the parse area, which is the character indexed by the contents of >IN. An ambiguous  condition exists if the number in >IN is greater than the size of the input buffer. 
If delimiter characters are present in the parse area after the beginning of the selected string, the string  continues up to and including the character just before the first such delimiter, and the number in >IN is  changed to index immediately past that delimiter, thus removing the parsed characters and the delimiter  from the parse area. Otherwise, the string continues up to and including the last character in the parse area,  and the number in >IN is changed to the length of the input buffer, thus emptying the parse area. 
Parsing may change the contents of >IN, but shall not affect the contents of the input buffer. Specifically, if  the value in >IN is saved before starting the parse, resetting >IN to that value immediately after the parse  shall restore the parse area without loss of data. 

#### 3.4.1.1 Delimiters 

If the delimiter is the space character, hex 20 (BL), control characters may be treated as delimiters. The set  of conditions, if any, under which a “space” delimiter matches control characters is implementation defined. 
To skip leading delimiters is to pass by zero or more contiguous delimiters in the parse area before parsing. 

#### 3.4.1.2 Syntax 

Forth has a simple, operator-ordered syntax. The phrase A B C returns values as if A were executed first,  then B and finally C. Words that cause deviations from this linear flow of control are called control-flow  words. Combinations of control-flow words whose stack effects are compatible form control-flow  structures. Examples of typical use are given for each control-flow word in Annex A. 
Forth syntax is extensible; for example, new control-flow words can be defined in terms of existing ones. 
This Standard does not require a syntax or program-construct checker. 

#### 3.4.1.3 Text interpreter input number conversion 

When converting input numbers, the text interpreter shall recognize both positive and negative numbers,  with a negative number represented by a single minus sign, the character “-”, preceding the digits. The  value in BASE is the radix for number conversion. 

### 3.4.2 Finding definition names 

A string matches a definition name if each character in the string matches the corresponding character in the  string used as the definition name when the definition was created. The case sensitivity (whether or not the  upper-case letters match the lower-case letters) is implementation defined. A system may be either case  sensitive, treating upper- and lower-case letters as different and not matching, or case insensitive, ignoring  differences in case while searching. 
The matching of upper- and lower-case letters with alphabetic characters in character set extensions such as  accented international characters is implementation defined. 
A system shall be capable of finding the definition names defined by this Standard when they are spelled  with upper-case letters. 

TRAILER  ANSI X3.215-1994  19

### 3.4.3 Semantics 

The semantics of a Forth definition are implemented by machine code or a sequence of execution tokens or  other representations. They are largely specified by the stack notation in the glossary entries, which shows  what values shall be consumed and produced. The prose in each glossary entry further specifies the  definition’s behavior. 
Each Forth definition may have several behaviors, described in the following sections. The terms “initiation  semantics” and “run-time semantics” refer to definition fragments, and have meaning only within the  individual glossary entries where they appear. 

#### 3.4.3.1 Execution semantics 

The execution semantics of each Forth definition are specified in an “Execution:” section of its glossary  entry. When a definition has only one specified behavior, the label is omitted. 
Execution may occur implicitly, when the definition into which it has been compiled is executed, or  explicitly, when its execution token is passed to EXECUTE. The execution semantics of a syntactically  correct definition under conditions other than those specified in this Standard are implementation  dependent. 
Glossary entries for defining words include the execution semantics for the new definition in a “name Execution:” section. 

#### 3.4.3.2 Interpretation semantics 

Unless otherwise specified in an “Interpretation:” section of the glossary entry, the interpretation semantics  of a Forth definition are its execution semantics. 
A system shall be capable of executing, in interpretation state, all of the definitions from the Core word set  and any definitions included from the optional word sets or word set extensions whose interpretation  semantics are defined by this Standard. 
A system shall be capable of executing, in interpretation state, any new definitions created in accordance  with 3. Usage requirements. 

#### 3.4.3.3 Compilation semantics 

Unless otherwise specified in a “Compilation:” section of the glossary entry, the compilation semantics of a  Forth definition shall be to append its execution semantics to the execution semantics of the current  definition. 

### 3.4.4 Possible actions on an ambiguous condition 

When an ambiguous condition exists, a system may take one or more of the following actions: 
– ignore and continue; 
– display a message; 
– execute a particular word; 
– set interpretation state and begin text interpretation; 
– take other implementation-defined actions; 
– take implementation-dependent actions. 
The response to a particular ambiguous condition need not be the same under all circumstances. 

TRAILER ANSI X3.215-1994 20

### 3.4.5 Compilation 

A program shall not attempt to nest compilation of definitions. 
During the compilation of the current definition, a program shall not execute any defining word, :NONAME,  or any definition that allocates dictionary data space. The compilation of the current definition may be  suspended using [ (left-bracket) and resumed using ] (right-bracket). While the compilation of the current  definition is suspended, a program shall not execute any defining word, :NONAME, or any definition that  allocates dictionary data space. 

TRAILER  ANSI X3.215-1994  21

# 4. Documentation requirements 

When it is impossible or infeasible for a system or program to define a particular behavior itself, it is  permissible to state that the behavior is unspecifiable and to explain the circumstances and reasons why this  is so.

### 4.1.2 Ambiguous conditions 

A system shall document the system action taken upon each of the general or specific ambiguous conditions  identified in this Standard. See 3.4.4 Possible actions on an ambiguous condition. 
The following general ambiguous conditions could occur because of a combination of factors: 

- a name is neither a valid definition name nor a valid number during text interpretation (3.4 The Forth  text interpreter); 
– a definition name exceeded the maximum length allowed (3.3.1.2 Definition names); 
– addressing a region not listed in 3.3.3 Data Space; 

- argument type incompatible with specified input parameter, e.g., passing a flag to a word expecting an  n (3.1 Data types); 

- attempting to obtain the execution token, (e.g., with 6.1.0070 ', 6.1.1550 FIND, etc.) of a definition  with undefined interpretation semantics;

– overflow of a pictured numeric output string; 
– parsed string overflow; 

- producing a result out of range, e.g., multiplication (using *) results in a value too big to be represented  by a single-cell integer (6.1.0090 *, 6.1.0100 */, 6.1.0110 */MOD, 6.1.0570 >NUMBER, 6.1.1561 FM/MOD, 6.1.2214 SM/REM, 6.1.2370 UM/MOD, 6.2.0970 CONVERT, 8.6.1.1820 M*/); 
– reading from an empty data stack or return stack (stack underflow); 
– unexpected end of input buffer, resulting in an attempt to use a zero-length string as a name; 
The following specific ambiguous conditions are noted in the glossary entries of the relevant words: 
– >IN greater than size of input buffer (3.4.1 Parsing); 
– 6.1.2120 RECURSE appears after 6.1.1250 DOES>; 
– argument input source different than current input source for 6.2.2148 RESTORE-INPUT;

### 4.2.1 Environmental dependencies 

A program shall document the following environmental dependencies, where they apply, and should  document other known environmental dependencies: 

- considering the pictured numeric output string buffer a fixed area with unchanging access parameters  (3.3.3.6 Other transient regions); 

- depending on the presence or absence of non-graphic characters in a received string  (6.1.0695 ACCEPT, 6.2.1390 EXPECT); 
– relying on a particular rounding direction (3.2.2.1 Integer division); 

- requiring a particular number representation and arithmetic (3.2.1.1 Internal number  representation); 
– requiring non-standard words or techniques (3. Usage requirements); 
– requiring the ability to send or receive control characters (3.1.2.2 Control characters, 6.1.1750 KEY);

### 6.2.1350 ERASE CORE EXT 

( addr u -- )  If u is greater than zero, clear all bits in each of u consecutive address units of memory  beginning at addr . 

### 6.2.1390 EXPECT CORE EXT 

( c-addr +n -- )  Receive a string of at most +n characters. Display graphic characters as they are received. A  program that depends on the presence or absence of non-graphic characters in the string has an  environmental dependency. The editing functions, if any, that the system performs in order to  construct the string of characters are implementation-defined. 
Input terminates when an implementation-defined line terminator is received or when the string  is +n characters long. When input terminates, nothing is appended to the string and the display  is maintained in an implementation-defined way. 
Store the string at c-addr and its length in SPAN. 
 Note: This word is obsolescent and is included as a concession to existing implementations. Its  function is superseded by 6.1.0695 ACCEPT.
